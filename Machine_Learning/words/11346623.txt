		In my experience running a huge fan like this actually prevents most dust buildup as there is too much airflow for dust to accumulate anywhere except small gaps like the radiator.

Also the big brain move is to use the box fan as an exhaust and run all other case fans as intake through filters.

The box fan is sucking all the heat from the GPU(whe not vertically mounted) directly out of the case. You don't even need to have the box fan running on max. I did this for almost a year and gives moderate temp improvements, and no dust.

		I actually tested that awhile ago and I somehow managed to get worse preformance in the system I tested with. I think because the case had good airflow to begin with the box fan messed up the flow and didn't let air flow through the heatsinks. It was using a tower cooler so the airflow was going directly down on the top of the heatsink. Idk since you have an h510 it'd probably be better lol

Heat reduces lifespan.

Excessive heat, especially to the point of throttling or shutdown will significantly reduce lifespan.

				u/catkidtv

		Yes, this. The chip, the motherboard and the OS has built-in in safety mechanisms to not fry the CPU nor any other components. He can reddit and YouTube just fine until he finds a new cooler. But tablets or at least a decent Chromebook won't hurt in situations like these.

				u/Genotabby

		The pump is not a heat sink in this case. The pump will trap heat. If this was a metal heat sink then there would be fewer issues. You might not even last through a game or boot for long.

		One would need like 10 of their 3000RPM 140mm fans to match the CFM. Not sure which is better considering the static pressure advantage of the Nocs. Noise levels and frequency, this thing wins. I leave one on for white noise.

		If you're talking about a window A/C unit, we have those as well in the States.

I dont think box fans are popular because of their "performance", but because you can buy one for less than $20 USD at any box store, and they tend to last a couple years.

Their shape is convenient to put in a window, though.

		In all honesty, if you think about it, if you made a dust filter to fit this setup and eliminate that problem this would be a pretty baller and effective cooling, literally every single component is gunna be getting blasted with air directly ontop of it, change the front, top and back fans to exhaust and boom, that would be pretty good, again assuming a dust filter is in place

Cut a piece of womens panty hose from my GF closet and stretched that over the front fans/radiator when I reinstalled it. Temps dropped like 18C. EZ PZ
