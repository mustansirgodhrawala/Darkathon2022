                When the #FlareNetwork launches it will become a Decentralised Autonomous Organisation (DAO). This is a term you should become familiar with as you will likely see it much more in the future!

                F-Assets are assets which have been brought over from an external network to the #FlareNetwork, in a trustless manner. What's better is that F-Assets can generate you a #PassiveIncome, check the video for more details!

                What price did you sell your IOUs at? Here is the chart of $FLR / USD, as you can see, the current price is near all time lows.

For that reason, the majority of people (if this proposal is passed) will actually be able to accumulate more FLR than they initially started with.

                It's seems as though I've had a streak of bad luck recently as I've just found out I contracted COVID.

For this reason, I may not be so active in the coming days.

On the bright side, I feel much better in comparison to round one so I'm confident I can shake this off asap!ðŸ’ªâ�¤ï¸�

                You can't delegate FLR yet because it does not exist and the Flare Network has not launched.

Once tokens are distributed, it will be very similar to how you delegate $SGB.

Many guides out there on the process, here is just one:
