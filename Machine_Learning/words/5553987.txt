  Bitcoin Exchange

 Due to the situation in Ukraine, this service is
  heavily disrupted.

 We're interested in providing people with convenient ways to buy and sell
    Bitcoin with us.
 We have had experience with the following payment systems:



    SWIFT
    :
    Reliable. Fast enough.


    SEPA
    :
    Reliable and fast. Transactions may be pretty much instant, but not always.


    Skrill
    :
    Works but sometimes ask additional verifications after they have
        already charged the money.


    TransferWise
    :
    Fast and surprisingly reliable. The support is also friendly.


    WorldRemit
    :
    Trash. Sends threats to remove mentions of their company
        then ban you from using their service if you don't comply.


    Western Union, MoneyGram, RIA...
    :
    Generally work, but sometimes cancel transfers while they are being picked
        up and never explain as to why this has happened.


    Cash
    :
    Always works and very reliable!


    Xoom
    :
    Works. This is a Paypal service, it has been surprisingly reliable so far.



 The rate is usually around 4.5% based on market indicators. Please
    contact us for more details!
