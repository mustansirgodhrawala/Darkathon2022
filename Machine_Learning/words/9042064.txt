Hidden Services - Other Protocols
Volunteers last verified that all services in this section were up, or marked as DOWN, on: 2011-06-08
For configuration and service/uptime testing, all services in this section MUST list the active port in their address. Exception: HTTP on 80, HTTPS on 443.
For help with configuration, see the TorifyHOWTO and End-to-end connectivity issues.

P2P FileSharing
Running P2P protocols within Tor requires OnionCat. Therefore, see the OnionCat section for those P2P services.
IMPORTANT: It is possible to use Tor for P2P. However, if you do, the right thing must also be done by giving back the bandwidth used. Otherwise, if this is not done, Tor will be crushed taking everyone along with it.

The Pirate Bay - The Pirate Bay.
Chat centric services
Some people and their usual server hangouts may be found in the Contact Directory.

IRC
Use e.g. ChatZilla add-on for the IRC protocol (the Tor Project does not suggest installing browser addons unless you understand the risks), or a standalone client such as HexChat. Tails comes with Pidgin, which will work for IRC as well.

Dead Hidden Services
Do not simply remove services that appear to be offline from the above list! Services can go down temporarily, so we keep track of when they do and maintain a list of dead hidden services.

In addition to an onion simply being gone (Tor cannot resolve the onion), sites that display 404 (and use a known onion/URL based hosting service) are the only other thing that is considered truly DOWN. Presumably the account is gone.
If a service has been down for a while, tag it with ' - DOWN YYYY-MM-DD' (your guess as to when it went down).
If a tagged service on the above list of live hidden services has come back up, remove the DOWN tag.
If a tagged service is still down after a month, please move it (along with the DOWN tag) to the list of dead hidden services.
The general idea of the remaining four service states below is that, if the Hidden Service Descriptor is available, and something is responding behind it... the service is considered up, and we track that fact on the Main Page. If any of these subsequently go offline, append the DOWN tag and handle as above.
Hello world's / statements, minimal sites, services with low user activity, etc (while boring)... are listed as usual.
Broken services are those that display 404 (and do not use a known hosting service), PHP or other errors (or they fail silently)... any of which prevent the use of the service as intended. They also include blank pages, empty dirs and neglected status notes. Presumably the operator is in limbo. Broken services are tagged with ' (reason) - Broken YYYY-MM-DD' (your guess as to when it went broken)
Services that automatically redirect to another service (such as by HTTP protocol or script), have their redirection destinations noted in their descriptions. These are tagged with ' - Redir YYYY-MM-DD' (your guess as to when it went redir)
Sites that are formally closed via announcement are tagged with ' - Closed YYYY-MM-DD' (your guess as to when it went closed.
Is Online that HiddenService? This service is very useful in determining whether onions are up or not. It also gives a reason why they are down.
Sites on this list that have no chance of coming back (LE takedowns, dead for some time) should be archived to page dead services just in case they should ever be needed.
