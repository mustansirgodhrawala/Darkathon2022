@start9dave I'm very excited for this one myself. It was this on the roadmap that first got me into Start9. But realistically it was bitwarden that got me to love S9 within a week of purchasing.

@econengineer @start9dave Absolutely, bitwarden was not a selling point for me when I went to buy the embassy, but it has been the greatest quality of life improvement of all the apps currently offered.
