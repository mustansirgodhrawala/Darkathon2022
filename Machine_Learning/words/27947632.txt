				BusKill is finally here
							December 14, 2021January 11, 2022BusKill Team



			We're very excited to announce that BusKill cables are now available for purchase via CrowdSupply!

This week we launched the BusKill crowdfunding campaign on CrowdSupply.
The DIY guide to build a BusKill laptop kill cord was released last year. Designed to protect journalists, activists, travelers, and crypto traders -- this USB Dead Man's Switch can trigger your computer to lock if someone physically snatches your computer away from you while you're using it.
