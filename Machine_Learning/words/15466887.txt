            For all those who have “received” your order, could y’all send your proof photo to RiemusInfamous at ProtonMail dot com. Every site that sells Pre-Shredded cash uses the same script. Almost verbatim. If there are folks who legit got their order in the mail, it would be a godsend for you all to show the proof.

            Hello again Cash God. I tried to leave a review, and email you answering that same question about what happens when the volume reaches 100%, and I still didn't get a response back? Can you please email me back as soon as you can. Because I am interested in ordering from you guys when I have the funds to do so.

If this is real, it is probably made by the FBI or some computer nerd, yeah, probably a computer nerd. Hi computer nerd, how is your day? Bitch.

            @Ruben There is really no way to know as we constantly delete older records of who ordered what. However, if we notice several repeated orders from the same zip code or city. We'll check to see if it's the same address or person.

            I ordered from this service, and they sent me my package within 2 weeks, so quick shipping and awesome delivery. No complaints at all really. The packaging was good as well. I'm not a fan of the website though, I found it very confusing to navigate through, but overall I had no problems with the package getting here or the site itself. Not too many complaints with the site itself though to bad that it wasn't working well for me lol.

            Thank you Slim Jim, and Big boss for your responses, I appreciate it.

Id be lying if I said I didin't feel a little sketchy about this still.
You guys replying and the reviews are very intriguing, so I feel at this point to believe this is actually real I just have to say fuck it a order from this service it, lol.

I do believe and appreciate, peoples responses. Ive never bought from the dark web before, so in general I am kinda skeptical about buying anything on the dark web.

Like I said though, I am going to make a purchase on this service, and when I do, I will make sure people know about my experience, I know there is people like me who've seen this site.

I appreciate anyone else who gives me a response, or tells me about their experience.

            I finally have hope for my future. I've never had good role models or even real parents. It's mostly just just been me raising my siblings because of my parents drug addictions and mental illnesses. What's worse is living in a neighborhood filled with crime and poverty so the only way to make money is to join a gang and sell drugs. I was never proud of it but it was essential to keep food on the table and to get my siblings through school without worry. I was just laying in bed one night and stumbled across someone talking about the darkweb on a forum. I found a link to a dark web search engine and I searched ways to make money. This site came up as a link. I headed over to it and ordered. I never had experience with scams before so I took the risk. I actually got what I ordered and now I can finally stop calling myself scum. I also don't have to constantly be in danger anymore. This was a dream come true and a blessing.

            I have been using cash god for a few months now to get money from my family in the US. I am disabled and have no income but I do have funds through my social security checks which are always late. The shipping on this package took longer than expected which frustrated me, but i got over it since it was a relatively large order by cash god standards and other than that everything went smooth. The deal is very fair and that is why I continue to use them.

It is not just Monero or Bitcoin or some other cryptocurrency that can easily be copied to be worth less than their true value. It is the actual currency bills.

It was a little slow getting here but don't forget how much you purchased from them! If you need your stuff quick, go for the express shipping.

            @raull :D if you are referring to the stack of 100$ bills in the proof picture, that is just to show you how much money you will get. But yes, we cannot ship more than 65k due to shipping restrictions. That being said, we can definitely put more money into a box for a bigger haul if you need it. We can work around any budget and we hope that you will give us the opportunity to prove ourselves.

            Easy to pick this over any minimum wage or office job any time. I can literally do whatever I want now and don't have to worry about living paycheck to paycheck like I always have. I have family to take care of and this has definitely been a great service to use.

            Hey there thanks for the review Abe, we always ship our items out within 24hrs of placing your order and most of our regular orders are sent out on Mondays and Thursdays, so if you placed your order on a thursday then expect your package by monday evening thats what usually happens :). Just a thought though, i'd go with express but its up to you :)!

            Every time I go to these websites I read every page including the reviews page. If this were a scam site then it would only have 100 or so reviews, it would have terrible html formatting, and it would look worse than the original. I found a site that had all the exact same text on it as this one but it had no reviews and the whole design of it looked like there was no effort put into it. That's how I could tell this one was the original real one. It has such a good UI and good detail put into every page. That's how you can tell it's professional. Anyway I've ordered here before and got what I ordered. They're a good dark web company to buy from. Just give them a chance.

I have to take care of her day and night and find someone to take care of her for cheap so I can go to work and pay for the neverending pile of medical bills.
The package did come a little late because of how far away I am from the nearest city but thank you. You guys are my saviors.

            I tried to reach out to you guys through the PGP public key on your website and no one has responded back. I paid for the god package and wanted to change my chosen denominations. I'm a little mad. Should've known better than to buy from you guys after the hard time I had with the last order that was supposed to be for $20K and was only $17000 at the end of it all.

Looking for your support along with an adjustment on the promised amount of denominations.

I need to know a way to contact you guys, because I need this money fast.

            Heyyyy guys I am from the United States and I had a questioning about the delivery time, I'm going to order the largest amount on this website. So here is my question. Since I'm ordering from the US it seems odd that you are charging me with $60 shipping fee and your not giving an estimate of how fast it would take to get the package. It is much faster than normal international shipping. I will be ordering from the United States for the first time and I'm so nervous about this. Can you estimate as to how fast it would take to get my package?

            It was good I came here when I did. It all started when I was in a car accident. I was arrested and taken to court for apparently being responsible for the accident. Now I gotta pay like $20,000 to the lady that hit me. I'm so glad I found this website and now I can pay her what I owe her for cheap even though the accident was clearly her fault and not mine. Atleast I can come here to solve my problems. I'll be coming here again.

            I received what I paid for today! It took over THREE WEEKS after I paid for OVERNIGHT, the shipping company basically doesn't have a support system. I tried contacting the cashgod people and they said it's due to some security measures. idk how it works but the shipping times are so inaccurate, but at least I have my money now. I'll definitely be coming back for more but the shipping times are way off. If you're thinking of buying here, just pay for it and forget it for at least 2 weeks. I paid for Plus on the 19th April and it arrived yesterday. I am happy and pissed at the same time. The bills are almost new, idk how these were gonna be shredded. I haven't bought anything but my cousin who is a banker says it's real so I'll be trying it soon enough. Fuck you guys and thank you.

            Bruh I was just sitting here a week ago thinking that this was too good to be true but thankfully it was real. I can do whatever the hell I want now. Packaging was a little strange though but it has to be that way to get through customs. Don't worry about how long the package takes to deliver. They always give you what you want.

            Sometimes receiving your tracking number and receiving your package will take a little while. It's just because of bulk orders. We might have to use private shipping companies sometimes because our regular shipping routes will be under surveillance so we have to ship them in a more secure way which comes with extra fees. Also customer support might also be slow sometimes because we all do more with our lives than just sitting here looking at and packing your orders. We will get to them when we can.

            @Batman I've bought from Wolf Street before and their quality of bills is terrible. Cash God has good quality. This isn't the first time someone has mentioned Wolf Street as it's been around on different onion addresses previous to 2017 so I know their quality which sucks. Cash God is the way to go and since they have better quality they obviously don't buy from Wolf Street. Cash God started in 2017 as far as I can tell and they've always been good to me.

            I know this site is real but there are two problems. One is the terrible and never responsive customer support and two is the hidden fees they never tell you about.I probably won't be receiving my order now anyway as they said the shipping was free but now it's more than $72. I was willing to pay it but I literally have no money to pay for it. I wish they would have told me about it before so I would have had money set aside for the freight cost but I don't.

I would have remained homeless,  thank the universe for zak, I was let out of foster care wen I turned 18, I wasn't even given a blanket, I slept on the streets for 7yrs, I have no education and no skill. ooh lord, I thought I would keep doing menial jobs and working extra shifts for the rest of my life, the US you see on TV is a lie, a lot of people are homeless and the state knows about it, and has done nothing. Thank universe someone showed me this site. I spend only little from my packages, I save and trade the rest. I don't feel connected to this country, I'm saving to leave, I want to start a new life somewhere else.

            @sagefromthesouth bad advise, letting many people on this site will bring the attention of the FBI, remember this is illegal. If the FBI finds about this, Brad will get caught and we all we stop getting free cash. @khafi simply tell her that your friend asked you to keep it and return it the next day. Then change the location, hiding it behind your drawer was stupid. Remember, if she ask you what your friend does, simply say you don't know, you are just doing him/her a favor or the person was thrown out of the house and didn't want to move around with that amount of cash.

            I want to get this off my chest. Last year, I bought cash worth of $50000, my package arrived after 2 months(a really long time). I was in a lot of cash debt and the money didn't come through for me when I needed it.  When it came it was $100 short, I didn't mind because it was enough to solve my needs.
Another time I paid for cash worth $75000, I received the package after 1 month(fair). In that package I got $75200($200 excess), Big bullshit brad!
Am I the only one who experience this carelessness?
CashGod, Brad(whatever) this is unethical for a business, There is no promptness in your delivery and You guys have problems with Numbers.
Get a fucking money counting machine, it doesn't cost more than $200. Employ more hands to help process your delivery  if the amount of orders are much, it will make things faster and easier.
Customer satisfaction should be your priority.

My order was supposed to be sent to the address of a US Postal Service drop location in New York City. Well it's showing up in Atlanta Georgia so I guess they sent it somewhere else because nobody answered the door at this location yesterday. So I called them and they said they mailed it to my old address in New York. So now I want it mailed to a different address. What do I do now?

Overall, I'm really pleased with the experience I've had with these guys. They are very reliable and send notes when they say they will. The only downside is that sometimes one has to wait for them to get what one wants in stock but this is not their fault. The best thing is that they are very nice, but also anonymous - you don't know who's behind the service.


I especially recommend this service for anyone who wants to buy euros or pounds anonymously.

            cashgod is the best. It's just that simple. The reason why I'm writing this review today is to share with you guys my experience with cashgod. Unlike many other places these days, they deliver what they promise. I ordered $1000 in pretty small denominations initially. After the delivery, I was so pleased with them that I decided to order $5000 more in bigger notes this time.

The delivery was even better this time, and the person delivering the cash was neither a black man nor black woman. Everybody at home thought I had a promotion after seeing all my new purchases! They were totally shocked to learn the truth. All in all, this is an excellent service with very good prices and fabulous customer support.

            I am writing this review after much consideration. I was even unsure whether I would publish it or not. But now that things are sorted out, I think it is time to voice my opinion. So here's my story: I was looking for an online dollars purchasing service that could help me get dollars without too much hassel, and found cashgod. Their site looked pretty legit at first glance so I decided to give them a try. Alas, that was my first mistake!



The deal went smoothly at first. I ordered my dollars, they were delivered on time and all seemed well. Happy with the results, I thought what the heck let's order more. That's where things started to go downhill quickly. From that point on, it all started to become a total nightmare. I contacted customer support several times but no one ever returned my chat or email. I was at a loss and panicked. Finally, I decided to give up and order my dollars from another source. The other source turned out to be a scam , and I lost all my money. Guess who had my back by literally refunding me for my loss? You guessed it, cashgod! They openly admitted their fault and even gave me free Express shipping!



All in all, I must say that I did get some value for my money. Their service did work, but only when everything went smoothly. Now that's something no one can guarantee! To sum it up: if you want to buy dollars without too much hassle, cashgod is the way to go. Don't expect any immediate response from them though.

            I bought Euro from CASHGOD and I thought I was scammed. When I found out that my order wasn't going to be delivered in two days as I was told, but in four days, I became worried. What's worse is that when they responded to me, they didn't answer any of the questions I had about why it would take so long. Now a week later since my order actually got delivered instead of a day or two like they were supposed to, which makes no sense considering how much more expensive their overnight shipping is than regular shipping.

If you need cash fast, I recommend not using this website.

However, I found the wickr chat support a bit faster in response to my texts. So considering using the Wickr support. Also you could just order ahead of time. If you need some next week, order this week. That way you'll get it right on time as you wanted.

            I have been ordering from Cashgod for years now. For the most part I have always loved working with them. Recently, though, they have made some changes that are making me rethink my purchases.

One of the main changes is in their customer service department. The level of customer care has gone down quite a bit since they opened their doors to chat support instead of email support. Considering how often I order from them, this change makes it harder for me to get my issue resolved quickly when it arises- which causes me to spend more time waiting for an answer when using email support.

            I normally despise online scams but I thought it was worth a shot.
Initially I was excited as this site had the potential to make me millions overnight.
The site looked really shady, and I thought it might be a scam. After further investigating the website and seeing how legit they actually were, I decided to do business with them. To my surprise, Cashgod was as legit as they come.

Allow me to dive into details on how my dealings with cashgod went.

The first time I saw this site, my mind was blown, I could've sworn I hit the jackpot. I quickly spiraled down the reviews, the reviews seemed real and I was pretty convinced. Soon afterwards, I placed an order, this was on 24 October, 2021 12:54 PM

I made payments on 25 October 2021 11:57 AM and got an order confirmation email saying that they'll ship my order the following day. I paid 450$ in bitcoin, that includes the overnight shipping so it's supposed to take LITERALLY overnight.

But no, it wasn't delivered overnight or in two days maybe even three days. IT TOOK 5 Days, came in on 1 Nov, I had sent 5 emails asking wtf happened and they responded twice. Apparently overnight means 5 days, I wonder what Express shipping means.

However, despite the extra 4-day wait and them literally ignoring my messages, the bills were in good condition although  have spent most of it. I used most of it at stores and shops, I tried the bank by slipping one or two bill in regular cash deposits, it went through.So I'll definitely be buying again.

Quick suggestion: instead of bullshitting people with incorrect timing, just change it to the actual shipping time so people know what they're signing up for.

I am done venting! This was my experience.

            I went on the website to see what they have to offer. I found that they are selling cash for bitcoin and Monero. I looked through the reviews on the site and found that there was an issue with customer service. I am thinking of buying, any advise?

            I have been using cashgod for a couple of months now, and I am so happy with the service that I will be returning to this site time and again. As long as the service is being provided at this level, then it means that there are others out there who are just as pleased with working with cashgod. If you are looking to make turnovers quick, then by all means give cashgod a try today.
I hope you love their services as much as myself!

            I just received my order of $7000 worth of USD for Monero from Cashgod. I was a little bit hesitant at first, but the reviews where positive and the anonymous system provided a guarantee for my funds. All I can say is that it was a good decision to use this service to make quick cash with no strings attached! Thanks Cashgod!

            I tried to purchase $7000 worth of cash on this site, but I had some issues with the exchange rate. It said I would be able to get $7000 worth of cash for my $1400, but after waiting 3 days I only got $6540 worth of cash. It also charged me a lot more fees than advertised on their website for shipping. They don't seem like they're trustworthy at all, considering they're trying to take your money without you knowing how much you actually paid for something!

            Recently I needed to some money so I was surfing the dark web. One of the stores that caught my eye was CashGod. The prices were better than other shops in the dark web so I decided to give them a try.

However, when my order came, they just sent me dollars instead of pounds! This is very inconvenient because in England we use pounds to buy things, not dollars. And because it's in America, they would have dollars anyway, but that's even worse for me because then I have no idea how much money even equals £1 and it would be difficult for anyone else to figure out what value each bill is worth and there are different denominations of US currency too and that makes everything difficult as well

            I've been using CashGod for a couple of months now and I just love it - as long as you're cool with waiting on average four days for your funds, as I am, it's heaven! Definitely not as fast as cryptocurrency transactions but then again, those things need even more identity verification than some people are comfortable giving out online - so that's understandable. Their prices are really good and they have everything you hope to see: Euros, USD, GBP and so on all available at great rates!

            The only downside to using cashgod is that you're never 100% sure when they'll deliver your money. However, I find that risk/reward makes sense; I'm making below market value trades when getting my cash into crypto (I'm not recommending anyone do this), so when one of the deals goes wrong, I end up making below market value on a trade that was otherwise a win for me.

            cashgod is a fraud. it says that they can be trusted to securely and anonymously buy cash, but they are lying. first, I purchased some bitcoins from them with the intention of buying dollars anonymously - not only did my order take over an hour to confirm, but the service still charged me a lot of money for the service. then I tried to contact them about this issue and their customer service was completely unhelpful - after emailing them over 20 times without any response, they finally responded by sending me an automated message telling me how to talk to other sellers on their website for help instead of answering my question. what kind of fake company does that? very disappointing customer experience here.

            I ordered $10,000 USD in cash, paid in Bitcoin. I waited the full 10 days for my order to be delivered. When it finally arrived, it was short of $1,200. I asked for my balance. They refused to ship it because they claimed they were out of US currency and that I needed to wire them more Bitcoin. We had a back and forth about this for days until I decided that maybe, just maybe this is a scam!

            I was persuaded by the other testimonies left here and thought I would write one myself to provide a genuine review. I ordered £1500 (75x £20 notes). The first thing you do is make them happy with your purchase and send them your shipping details and name.  You then check your order number on their tracking page here http://cashgod2w7hzaeihf2d2bwd7xwtsjtbczbusbsyzqoqymks2g5l46eyd.onion/tracking.php to make sure your purchase is confirmed. For Scotland, the physical currency which should take no more than 1-4 days for express. The package arrived within 3 days and included a letter detailing their rules for unwrapping. I'd recommend reading the letter because the packaging is really tight and it would've been easy to tear a bill or in my case two. I have used it in a store in the next town, no problems. Next is HSBC

            We have received numerous emails about the tracking number problem and we
                are sorry about that, it's due to the large orders and it is a minor issue,

it will be resolved shortly
                and your
                orders should be back on track.
                We are sorry for any inconveniences.

                i started out buying stolen credit cards, some were legit and some were

scams, then i read about stack
                wolf, i tried it, it was another scam, i
                was still buying credit cards, I discovered this site sometime last month,

i was scared, i read the
                reviews, observed the site for a couple of days, then i decided to
                buy, I got my tracking number about 12hrs after i oredered, I bought the

basic package then, my package
                arrived 6 days after i got the tracking number,
                the packaging was very sneaky, I haven't make a better choice in my life

yet, I have a youtube channel
                now and i also bought a decent camera and a drone for content
                creation, I know this review is long, i am just thankful to the cashgod

team for giving me a chance at
                a better life. Reply

            My neighbour's son drives a mercedes benz c300 2015 model, his not up to 19and i'm sure
                it wasn't his parents that bought the car for him. I heard him talking withhis friends
                that also drive cool cars and all i could hear was darknet, deepweb and money.
                "yeah i know, i was stalking the guy" I really needed the financial breakthrough that he had,
                so i dumped my ego of being older than him, walked up to him and asked himto put me through whatever
                he was doing. He told me he runs an agency that develop digital solutions such as software and websites
                for small business here in *************. It was hard for me to believe, but i still pleaded with him
                that he should educate me on how to start up my own agency, but he simply replied that i should learn computer
                programming first.from the way he sounded, i realized it won't be an easy task for a 25 year old college graduate with no
                job. I knew i had to do something fast, so i started talking about what i heard him and his friends talking about the
                other day. He got provoked, when i asked him about the darknet, and that was a clear sign that he was hiding something. I told him to chill that he has known me all his life, and that i'm someone he should trust, but he ditched me, entered his clean white mercedes benz an drove off like i was not there. I felt devastated, lost and almost cried,but instead of learning programming, i started searching about the darknet, untill i stumbled on a quora post that explained to me
                everything about what a
                newbie has to know about the darknet.
                I learnt about the search engines for the darknet and on my first time of

using one, i simply asked it
                how to make money on the darknet.
                i saw alot of websites that sold things like, counterfeit, paypal accounts,

                and credit card. I immediately knew that my neighbour's son
                was into one of this, because i heard him having such conversations with
                his friend. So i picked the cheapest service, paid $150 dollars
                for a paypal account with $1000 dollars in it, but it ended up being a
                scam. That was when i approached my neighbour's son with anger and
                frustration, and threatened him that i will alert the cops about his silly
                darknet deals if he don't put me through. I could see the fear
                on his face as his face turned red, he finally agreed and told me that it's
                gonna be our little secret, and that i am welcomed to the team.
                He told me that i was gonna meet up with his friends so that they will put
                me through, but i thought it was gonna be a plan to kill me off
                so that i will not spoil their darknet deals, so i told him to shot the
                fuck up and tell me what i needed to now right this minute.
                He knew i was ready for anything, every body in the street knew i was a
                frustrated college graduate who couldn't land a job, and a frustrated man
                can be very dangerous. He had no choice but to start talking, he told me a
                lot of things about the darknet, things i did not even
                come across when i spent days searching about the darknet, but after a long
                talk, he still didn't mention to me on how to get money on the darknet,
                so i provoked again and told him to simply tell me where to get money on
                the darknet, no scam, no bullshit. He then asked me to open a protonmail
                account, write it on a piss on paper and give it to him, maybe he thought i
                was gonna live his house , but nah. I immediately used
                my smartphone to open the email account he requested i should open. He told
                me protonmail is a safe way to send email on the darknet
                so that you won't be tracked by the government. He then sent me a link
                right at that spot and told me it was time i stoped living a misreable life.
                The way he said it gave me hope. I rushed back home, powered on my rusty
                looking laptop that i've been using for almost a decade, connected to the internet,
                accessed the tor browser and protonmail, copied the link and pasted it on
                the url bar. Two months later, i made more money than i have ever made in more whole life.
                i wouldn't have belived cashgod if it didn't come from a trusted source

because it was too good to be
                true. If it wasn't for my guts, i'll still be a frustrated broke
                college graduate. sometimes we need to take a bold step to see the light.

            I visited the homeless yesterday and spent over $3,000. It was a way for me

to give out.
                most people here just blow their money away on drugs, materialistic

bullshits and hoes.
                Don't take this opportunity for granted and think it will last forever,

because you
                might want to place an order one day and be told that they don't sell cash

anymore.
                be wise, save, invest, give out to the less priviledged, get a job and live

a decent life.
                I'm worth over $500,000 now and i got 90% of it from cashgod. I would have

blown every
                package i ever bought away just like most of you do becasue you didn't work

for the money, but instead
                of that, i choose to save and invest every package. see this as a friendly

advice, think about the

            I was anxious when i received the package, i thought cashgod was the Feds

trying to capture criminals on

                    darknet by offering them huge ammount of money at an affordable price.

But i was just too high on

            my wife thought i robbed the bank when she worked in on me unboxing $30,000

with anxiety.
                she asked me where i got the huge sum of money from as she looked at me

straight in my eyes. I could
                not lie,
                so i had to say the truth. I told her i bought the money from the darknet

and to my greatest surprise,
                she has never
                heard of the darknet. I then told her to search about it using the

internet, but she has to be careful
                enough
                not to use google, rather she should use duckduckgo so that our ip address

won't be related to any
                search about
                the darknet. After hours of her reading about the darknet and accessing the

cashgod website, she
                believed me
                and then told me she wants to be a part of it. she has placed her first

order, and i'm still waiting to
                place another
                as soon as possible. We both hope this won't end anytime soon.

             Happy new year to our beloved customers.
                you guys are among the brave ones that were able
                to leverage our services and become financially free.
                Things will eventually be different this year, and we wont't be
                going anywhere anytime soon. We are right here for you guys, and together
                we are one and stronger than we have ever been before.

                We made few changes :

                1: We now ship to cuba.
                2: We reduced our prices so that it can be affordable for the less

priviledged
                3: We now offer the V.I.P package to people willing to pay. You don't

need to purchase ten packages
                to
                be eligible for a V.I.P package.
                -(V.I.P packages now range from $500,000 to $2,000,000.)
                4: We no longer convert V.I.P packages to currencies such as EURO and

Pounds, we only sell in
                dollars.
                5: You get to buy only once in a month.

                More changes might be coming soon, changes that will benefit both our

customers and us.

                You can start placing your order.

                    dont get it? Why do people bitch and moan about cheap cash. if they
                    dont like the service then go some where else. Plus, that leaves for
                    cash for us veterans to buy.Reply

                    already been scammed by one of these sites. I placed my order on this
                    website for a Basic package on May 27th @ 2 PM. I emailed them asking
                    for an update on my order as I'm being very cautious and skeptical right
                    now. No reply as of yet, but I will let all of you know if I ever hear
                    anything back. Otherwise, they took my bitcoin and ran like the other

                    came in a computer company box hidden in grey bags. Less than 4 days

                    I have been reading some of these reviews and you fuckers that are
                    complaining about anything at all should just shut the fuck up or leave
                    this world completely. You really want to complain that you big ass box
                    of cash was $20, $50, or even $100 short?? So fucking what!!!! You still
                    have a shitload more than you had before the packaged arrived so why
                    are you even looking a gift horse in the mouth? Assholes!Oh and
                    your package took one day longer to ship or two days longer to receive?
                    Again, so fucking what! At least you got the package and didn’t get
                    scammed like you thought you would! If I was Brad I would stop shipping
                    to any asshole that complained, left a bad review, or just flat out was
                    an asshole to him because you hate your life and feel the need to bring
                    everyone down with you. Better be glad it’s not me shipping the stuff
                    or half you mother fuckers would be cut off completely AND I would still
                    keep your BTC to show you how life isn’t fair and you can’t expect it

                I
                    am seriously concerned about our government. I think the Swiss is going
                    to experience a coup and if does the currency markets are going to go
                    to shit. Bitcoin and Gold will be the best resource.I could give
                    2 shits that I am stealing money from the gov buying preshred. I dont
                    even see it as stealing. I paid thousands of dollars in taxes and all
                    our gov does is give it to special interest groups.I am taking
                    my money back from the Swiss government and they can fuck themselves
                    while I spend my reclaimed cash the way I want too.Keep up the good work cashgod!KReply

                    c0mm@n3r you make a good point. I also have gotten screwed by a couple
                    of sellers on locabitcoins. They take a steep profit for themselves and I
                    payfor it. I started moving my coin though Brad as an alternative and
                    it was a good choice. Though every time I get a package from him I still
                    check the money for counterfeit. So far no found to date.Reply

                @Bmood – That is a good question.It
                    works like this – We take our preshred CHF and send them to a contact
                    we have in Luxembourg who then takes the cash and exchanges it for
                    Euros. This is why Euro, GBP and USD have a higher cost than CHF, we
                    have to pay our people to make the exchange.Spend WiselyBradReply

                    always around a holiday USD inventory runs low. If you are getting
                    regular monthly shipments those will not be impacted. If you are

                    this afternoon my order from cashgod arrived. Upon inspection of
                    the parcel was 2 sealed silver bags which contained 6,650 British Pound
                    Sterling. The notes where then checked for counterfeit using a Safescan
                    2985-SX with all bills passing inspection.Reply

                This
                    was my first purchase with cashgod. I bought the standard $6,650
                    package. Since it was my first transaction I used escrow (CoinMixer
                    Escrow Service).Process went smoothly from the time of order and
                    deposit with escrow company. It took 12 days to receive the cash. Cash
                    was in 20s, 50s, and 100s . Packaging was secure and cash well hidden.I will be ordering again.Thank you.Reply

                I spent almost $10,000 in cash last night and had the time of my life.I
                    didnt even go to bed yet. I had to post before I crash. cashgod is
                    awesome. I had my first threesome with 2 really hot strippers, rented a
                    stretched limo, and had my own VIP table service at a real popular club.I
                    could do this every night. Brad I hope you dont run out of cash. I am
                    living like a king. I think I am going to download the pic of Leo from

                    some are not. The Euro from cashgod is real (confirmed) and I have

                Look,
                    everything has its pros and cons. I am a Master with Brad. Which
                    basically means I have bought a shit ton of cash. The pros of this site.
                    It delivers real cash. Brad uses good stealth for the shipping. The
                    cons-you can only order once a month. Some bullshit about making sure
                    there is enough cash for everyone. If it were up to me I would just by
                    it all and fuck the rest of you. But no, I have to buy every month like
                    everyone else.If you are still on the fence. Dont do it!! You are not ready for this lifestyle. Plus it
                    means more cash for me.Reply

                cashgod is highly professional, knowledgeable about this work and
                    deadline focused. The cash delivery was on time and they are easy to
                    work with. I think he could improve on responding to messages faster. I
                    will definitely order with cashgod in the future. Only good things

                Please
                    make sure you bookmark cashgodplzcfmasy.onion. We are aware of a hijack
                    from our site to another using a @secmail.pro email address. People
                    with good eyes noticed that the onion address in the pictures was ours
                    but the address of the site was different. We are working on it.As
                    most of you are existing clients this may not be so much of an issue
                    but note we did NOT change our email. Please keep your correspondence
                    with cashgod@protonmail.com.We
                    have made major changes to the website. These include security measures
                    and customer service changes, which are reflected in the ordering
                    process.1. The comment form now has a captcha because we noticed an increasing number of hacking attempts.2.
                    Because there are still too many idiots who can not follow simple
                    instructions, we have integrated an ordering process on our site, to
                    keep things even more simple. Nothing changes for our monthly
                    subscribers. You will get your package as usual.For all new
                    customers there is now the possibility to place their order directly via
                    the website. For the hacker aka script-kiddies: go fuck yourself - we
                    arn't amateurs, we are unhackable! BradReply

                    wanted to take a min and thank Brad. I ordered from that scam site
                    with the secmail.pro email address. The site look just like this one but
                    I didnt notice the onion address and the pictures were not the same.
                    Well I was screwed.I told Brad what had happened and asked if
                    this was a scam to please not take my money. I bought the 6,650 and it
                    actually arrived. Brad even threw in 2,000 extra which more than
                    covered what I lost at the scam site with the secmail.pro email address.Thank you Brad. People Need to
                    Know.Reply

                Be
                    careful!!! Like some others that commented here I was scammed by a
                    clone as well. cashgod is pretty famous in the underground world but
                    as a noob I didnt know any better. Hint: notice the real cashgod
                    onion address is in the pictures.Brad and his team are
                    fantastic. They helped me overcome my fear and distrust since getting
                    screwed twice before with cloned sites. I did my homework this time and
                    researched with TRUSTED darkweb veterans who know what is what around
                    here and the gave me the correct cashgodplzcfmasy.onion cashgod
                    address. I have made sure to keep this link bookmarked so that I am not
                    fooled again. There are so many clones out their its hard to know what
                    is real or not. All I can tell you is do your research (which is hard)
                    with people who REALLY KNOW the darkweb. Its not as easy as it seems.BTW..
                    the money you get from these guys is not counterfeit. It is real cash,
                    like others I tested it for counterfeit and used a pro grade counter,
                    every bill passed and as others have commented their stealth shipping is
                    insane!Reply

                My
                    biggest issue about this place is it is hard to find. There are so many
                    scam sites that copied cashgod and it makes it hard to find this
                    one. I know that is not their fault, but it is frustrating.The
                    product itself is great. The currency is real and I can spend it very
                    easily. I have not had a problem yet. This is my third order with my
                    latest for a standard. What i really like is how well they hide the
                    contents of the shipment. Out of 3 orders each was different. I wont
                    type them as I am not sure they would want that information public.Overall
                    if you are looking for a cheap source for cash this is the place. I
                    know they do not like posting onion addresses but I would think their
                    own is permitted. Bookmark this site cashgodplzcfmasy.onion and save
                    yourself the hassle of trying to find it every time.Mr. BlackReply

                This
                    was my first transaction using a TOR browser. I was very nervous. I
                    placed my order for a $1300 on Friday the 4th of May. I sent the bitcoin
                    to Brad to a wallet address he provided. After 3 or so hours I got a
                    shipping confirmation and tracking number stating my package would
                    arrived 14th of May. BTW I used the free shipping option. The package
                    arrived this morning via USPS. The envelope was a generic USPS envelope
                    and was sealed. Inside the envelope was a shrink wrapped DVD and a paid
                    invoice for $19.95 for the DVD. At this point I thought I received the
                    wrong piece of mail. I opened the DVD and inside was a sealed black bag.
                    I used some scissors and cut the top of the bag open. Inside was $1300
                    in various bills. Most of the bills were in fairly good condition.I
                    know people are probably looking at this site and wondering whether or
                    not to order. I was one of those people. Overall I am please with the
                    transaction and would do another order with them.Reply

                I
                    previously posted but it may not have gone through due to the hack. I
                    ordered day before yesterday, requested overnight and BTC prices rose so
                    I only had enough in my wallet to buy standard delivery once I was
                    contacted. I used the cashgod@protonmail.com
                    email and got instructions. I looked at the shipment schedule and it
                    looks like a standard shipment wont ship until Monday since standard
                    will not ship today correct? Thanks.Reply

                Blackhat check your email….. You should be all set. We added extra cash that should cover you and then some.The
                    hack has been resolved for now. As you know in the dark net this is
                    normal business and goes with the territory. Be careful when you order
                    or communicate with us and always use cashgod@protonmail.com.
                    Capital letters or mix of capital and lower case letters are the same thing. As long as it is cashgod@protonmail.com
                    you are fine. Always make sure the onion in the picture matches the
                    onion for the site you are on. The hackers used a site that looked like
                    ours with a similar onion address but not the same. The pictures had our
                    onion in them, they didnt change them, but their onion was very similar
                    so if you didnt pay attention you might not have noticed. We are
                    working on making some major changes to the site coming up to reduce
                    things like this and make it a little easier for our clients to
                    recognize if they are on a scam site or not. However, technology being
                    what it is, it is not fool proof and it will eventually be overcome. Its
                    just the way things are.We are operating normally now. Feel
                    free to claim your cash. Dont let hackers stop you. Its what they want
                    to do anyway. We wont be deterred neither should you.Spend Wisely My FriendsBradReply

                Hey All,I
                    was *highly* skeptical. In fact I thought cashgod was selling high
                    quality counterfeit and saying it was real cash. I placed my order on
                    Thursday morning with 2-3 day shipping, tracking received Thursday
                    night, package received today. This is not counterfeit, it’s 100%
                    genuine and I took it to the bank. I see good reviews and I am going to
                    add my voice to theirs. I will be definitely getting 10,000k next time
                    round.May you all enjoy your cash in health and prosperity,PinkReply

                    have been a long time client with Brad. He is a good man and really
                    does not need to do this. I think he sells this cash so that every hard
                    working person has the opportunity to be free from debt and bill
                    collectors. Thats just my opinion.BTW Brad the new guy is doing a
                    good job. My latest package had everything packaged professionally. I
                    was surprised he got $10,000 in such a small space.Reply

                    tried these guys out with a test order – Basic – early last week. When
                    I sent the email to order I received a reply within 5 hours with
                    payment instructions. I paid using BTC and within another 3 hours I
                    received tracking information. The order took 7 days to arrive via
                    Fedex. The packaging was a Fedex box and inside were 2 DVD’s and an
                    invoice for them totaling $22. When I opened the DVD’s there was cash
                    inside. I tested the bills using a pen and each bill passed. The bills
                    are VERY used but they are real.Reply

                FYI
                    to our GBP buyers we have some high value orders to process which will
                    lower our inventory and may fully deplete it. We will know in the next
                    24 hours if those orders follow through.I get a lot of questions
                    as to why I do not respond to each post…. Answer… It takes too much
                    time. When we were smaller that was easier to do, now not so much.
                    However let me address some questions:Is the USD, Euro, GBP
                    counterfeit. Again, this question should be easy to answer for yourself
                    if you have read our website. The answer is NO it is genuine currency
                    that can be used or deposited in the bank. Again, do not deposit more
                    than 10,000 into an account within a 24 hour period. In the USA I would
                    recommend it being less than $9,000 now. Too many people are depositing
                    $9,900 to avoid reporting. The best advice is to spend the cash if you
                    can. Stay away from banks and credit cards. They are evil entities
                    looking to drain you and your family. Get yourself on a cash budget.
                    That way what you spend your money on is your business.Another
                    popular question …. Is this real? Can you prove it? What do I need to do
                    to order? First, how the fuck do we respond to the first two questions?
                    Think about the logic in that for just a second. NOTHING can be proven
                    on the dark net. Period. Nothing. Reviews and comments are bullshit
                    anywhere. Anyone can post, Anywhere, Anytime. If you get false
                    confidence in people who you do not know telling you its ok. Then you
                    need to reassess yourself. Unfortunately, there are scams out there. Its
                    the cost of doing business on the dark net. High Risk = High Reward. We
                    are doing our best to track down people who clone our site through
                    convert measures in our code. However, it is not always 100%. Plus if
                    you find a site through a 3rd party advertiser on the clear net it is
                    most likely a fake or Law Enforcement setting a trap. Only use THW http://cashgodplzcfmasy.onion
                    .
                    Again being the darknet there are lots of scam THW but if you look you
                    will see reputable VPN providers who show this link as a starting point
                    for new users to the dark net. It is the ONLY 3rd party site we are on.Do
                    not send us emails asking how do I order or what is the next step? Its a
                    waste of time. The ordering directions are clear on the site. Follow

                    have ordered from cashgod 3 times. I was REAL skeptical at first

                    you shipped me. Now it has jumped in price. I have stopped my carding
                    business and now buy from you exclusively. I say to anyone waiting,
                    stop, and start ordering now. You can only get cash every couple of

                Freedom 269 (Love the name BTW)THW
                    (The Hidden Wiki) is a good source for legit DW links. There are others
                    out their too, but THW is good starting point and it is well trusted
                    and respected in the community. Be careful on the DW. Brad was right
                    about not going to sites that advertise on the CW (Google, youtube,
                    etc). They are either scams or law enforcement. Another good way is ask
                    for a ridiculous amount of whatever they are selling. If they are
                    willing to sell you then its probably a scam. For example, I was told
                    about a site selling cheap molly. I told him I was a big dealer and
                    needed 10,000 pills overnight and I was willing to pay extra for the
                    delivery. No hesitation, the guy replies with payment info. I knew it
                    was bull shit.When I was first introduced to Brad I did the
                    same thing and asked for 1 million. Guess what? He told me no and told
                    the rules we all here over and over. I bought my first 10k and never
                    looked back. I buy ever 2-3 weeks. I would buy more, but like everyone
                    else, I am not allowed too.Reply

                    haven’t had any tracking or anything at all really. Just not sure how
                    this works with it being a first order ( of many to come ) from RC. This
                    isn’t a negative post because it does say delivery 3-4 days and im in

                I am a regular customer here and now get regular shipments every month. It has changed my life.The
                    real scammers are the government. Many countries used to be on the gold
                    standard. Meaning for every dollar printed the government held one
                    dollar worth of gold in its reserve. Now the government doesn’t use that
                    standard and they just print money with nothing backing it. A dollar
                    bill is worth a dollar only because the government says it is.Guys
                    like cashgod are fucking around with their system. I am sure they
                    are going after them with everything they got with fake reviews and DOS
                    attacks etc. Of course they cant find them via tor so they do the next
                    best thing and try to scare people into not buying the pre shred cash.Look
                    people the government has fucked us over and big banks and greedy
                    politicians have taken over by tweaking the system in their favor. The
                    team at cashgod has evened the score and let us have our money back.
                    The money belongs to the people. Plus, you could make much better use
                    of the money than your government.Just my two micro bits for what its worth.Reply

                    We use cashgod to launder our bitcoin to cash. Its better than
                    using LBC and we get real cash in return. If you are involved in
                    “nontraditional” lines of business this is a excellent resource for your
                    cash management.Reply

                UpdatesWe
                    have updated our inventory across the board, which is a good thing
                    since we were running low. We have had another record week, for what
                    reason, I have no clue. We are getting a number of special requests for
                    low denominations for high level packages. We will do our best to fill
                    them but you may get higher denominated bills to fill the balance. We
                    only have a finite number of smaller bills. Plus we do not want to add
                    unnecessary volume to the packages.Again, for the millionth
                    time, read the directions before you order. If you dont follow the
                    directions we are not filling your order.There are some
                    ingenious methods of how people are using their pre shred cash. If you
                    care to share your methods please do. Thank you to The Banker and those
                    who have already done so. Remember, the only person who can change your
                    life is you! The possibilities are endless.Spend Wisely My FriendsBradReply

                    love the service here. I started loaning out my preshreded cash to
                    people with a 20% fee and business is fantastic. I use the cash that
                    comes into the packages that why I never need to deposit it. I pay a
                    couple of guys to handle “enforcement’ for me. It has been a gold mine.Reply

                This
                    is one of the better sites on the dark web. The ordering process was
                    straight forward and delivery was prompt. My only complaint would be
                    with post ordering communication since it takes them a bit to respond.

                Advice
                    to all men out there. Ya’ll wonder if you dick is big enough. As a
                    woman, and knowing lots of women I have this to say… Your penis size
                    does not matter. Women want a man with money. I know that sounds shallow
                    but they want to know you can provide for them. Love fades really fast
                    if you have to eat rice and beans every night. Buy from cashgod and
                    get yourself a woman.GennyReply

                The
                    politicians are put there to give you the idea you have freedom of
                    choice. You don’t. You have no choice. You have owners. They own you.
                    They own everything. They own all the important land, they own and
                    control the corporations that’ve long since bought and paid for, the
                    senate, the congress, the state houses, the city halls, they got the
                    judges in their back pocket, and they own all the big media companies so
                    they control just about all of the news and the information you get to
                    hear. They got you by the balls. They spend billions of dollars every
                    year lobbying to get what they want. Well, we know what they want. They
                    want more for themselves and less for everybody else. But I’ll tell you
                    what they don’t want. They don’t want you ruining the economy by buying
                    stolen cash from “cashgod”. This is real but buy at your own risk of
                    disturbing the owners of this world.Reply

                    However all tracking numbers should be out. As you can imagine, we were
                    hit hard over the past few days with last minute orders for arrival by
                    Tuesday. Those in the USA have an extra day ( you know what I mean).Make
                    sure you pay attention to your quote amount including the decimal and
                    the number of zeros. If you cant do that, do not order. You need to
                    understand basic math and follow directions.Prices may be going
                    up soon. We will not be announcing in advance when that will happen. Get
                    your orders in as soon as possible if you want to take advantage of the
                    lower rates. Once they increase we will not honor old pricing.Spend Wisely My FriendsBradReply

                Now
                    days I just sit on my couch and watch TV. I pay cleaners to clean my
                    apartment. I order fast food for every meal. I literally don’t do a damn
                    thing except eat, watch TV and sleep. Thank you Brad for helping me
                    get to the American Dream of doing nothing.Reply

                    Now I have plenty of spending money. Fingers crossed I can turn 10k

                Ordered
                    my first package on the 15th. Had issues with emails being returned
                    when I sent my transaction number which made me a bit nervous. However, I
                    noticed that the java script has to be enabled for the proton mail to
                    work. This is disabled when on the highest security setting. I dropped
                    mine to safer or about the middle just long enough to send the message.
                    Think it went through now. For those of you that have problems with
                    emails timing out when sending, you might try this. Anyway,
                    looking forward to getting a tracking number the weekend slowed my
                    process. Also, when it is day here it is night there so I have to
                    account for time differences in working hours. Here is keeping my
                    fingers crossed that I will receive my order and then I will make a
                    bigger purchase.Reply

            Special Agent Sean Keith - Federal Bureau of Investigation -- Financial Crimes DivisionApril

                My
                    opposition and my plea for users to steer clear is rooted only in the
                    fact the website’s operators are reptilian and anti-human. They come
                    many light-years away from Earth and settle on our planet to cause
                    financial chaos and to destroy the human race.After careful
                    studying of our prior investigations, I can now say with great
                    confidence that the operators behind this website “cashgod” were
                    accessory to the orchestraters of the 2008 depression. They knew about
                    it beforehand and assisted in the financial ruin. These website
                    operators are key players in the reptilian agenda, and while I wish to
                    capture them, these reptilian entities continue to elude us since the
                    beginning of mankind and my efforts would be futile. They possess
                    ability to “teleport” and various more other-worldly mechanisms and
                    tools to avoid detection.So while the Agency is aware that if we
                    do have a lead on “cashgod,” they will employ highly-advanced
                    reptilian technology and avoid detection.I want to stress to the
                    website users, the money is real. Bank tellers and ATMs will accept it
                    as genuine cash. But you are buying it from reptilians and anti-human
                    entities who seek to destroy the world. Is free money worth selling your
                    soul to the devil?Think about that for a minute.My name is Special Agent Sean and this is my
                    advice.Reply

                Is
                    it possiable to setup an arrangement using your organization as a
                    payment processor. We instruct our clients to pay to your crypto address
                    and you in tern send us the pre shreded cash? Could we include a code
                    word with each “order” so that you know the address to send the cash?We may have times we order more than
                    $50k? What happens in that situation?Reply

                I needed a car and used cashgod to make it happen. I did my research before I did anything and it worked
                    out.Here is what I learned:1. I bought the standard ($6,650)2. Ask for large bills.3. Buy
                    your car (used) at auction.4. Make sure the out the door price is less than $6,6505. Per IRS guidelines
                    any transaction in cash $10,000 or higher has to be reported.6. I paid $5,700 for my car after fees and taxes.I
                    know its not as glorious as to what some other people are doing here
                    but I did get a good deal. I paid $1000 to buy the standard package and ended up
                    with a car that’s worth about $7,000 if I sold it to a private seller.Reply

                Hello My FriendsLast
                    week was very busy. Many orders from the USA looking for cash before
                    IRS deadline of 17 April. Lots of people asking for overnight. Needless
                    to say, shits been crazy around here. I am adjusting our volume levels
                    for USD to medium. If you are looking to buy and get your cash before 17
                    April you need to order now! We will only fill orders on a first come
                    first served basis. If we do not respond to your order request it means
                    we can not fill it due to inventory. We expect more cash arriving in the
                    next few days. When that happens I will get you know.We are
                    still getting order requests that do not include shipping addresses. We
                    had one dumb fuck yesterday that was upset that his package did not come
                    overnight, but he never sent the address. We sent 4 emails. He changed
                    his email address. That is NOT our problem. You are responsible to make
                    sure you include all the proper information and are following our
                    ordering instructions. Its pretty simple, many people do it and get
                    their cash quickly. You can too, just follow the directions.Spend Wisely My FriendsBradReply

                ANNOUNCEMENT!Hello Girls and Fellas,We made profound changes to our site.From
                    a six-package system, we switched to a three-package system. We also
                    have Bitcoin live exchange rates built in. These are updated every 24
                    hours.We made these changes because we've seen more difficulties
                    with our clientele and as we get more and more monthly buyers, we
                    wanted to simplify the process for everyone. An order can now be made
                    with a single email. Read the steps below the packages. Everything is
                    explained there.For our permanent customers everything stays the same.Another
                    important note: please make sure you are on the right page. Check the
                    URL in the header-image with the one in your browser address field.This comment will be pinned for some
                    time at the top.One
                    more request, do not spam us with your "test" comments. If you want to
                    see if we are "legit" then write a comment on how you came across our
                    service and see if it will get posted on here.BradReply

                    land and have no idea what they are doing. I was reading in the paper
                    today some dumb ass posted info about how he bought stuff on the dark
                    net and posted it on youtube. Guess who showed up at his front door? You
                    guessed it the friendly men in blue. Why people post anything about
                    dark net activities on the clear net is something I will never
                    understand. Google and other companies hand info off to the NSA and Feds

                Sounds
                    like you guys have found my out about my best kept secret on crypto
                    trading. These guys are great for covering loses. If you season the cash
                    (leave it in a checking account for a couple months) you can open up a
                    trading account anywhere cryptos or otherwise. When you make gains you
                    are multiplying your gains. When it drops you can cover your own loses.
                    Its a sweet deal.Reply

                Hey Guys/Gals here are a few updates…………………………………..People
                    are starting to pay attention to the ordering rules. Thank you it helps
                    keep shipments going out in a timely manner. However, we are seeing a
                    problem with people paying after their 24 hours quote expires.DO
                    NOT PAY AFTER YOUR QUOTE HAS EXPIRED !!! Otherwise your payment will be
                    lost! We are serious about this. If you pay after 24 hours your wallet
                    ID is not longer valid. We do not have access to it. It doesn’t matter
                    how much you beg and tell us… There is nothing we an do. If you feel
                    your 24 quote is nearly up, email us for a new quote. It is that simple !Also,
                    our treasury contact has notified us that 96 series 100 USD bills are
                    no longer coming in. Most of these bills have been destroyed. Please do
                    not ask for 96 series 100’s USD. We an not accommodate the request. We
                    do however still see large amounts of 2003 series 100 USD bills. As of
                    this time they are not impacted.One more thing….. dont ask for 1’s and 5’s we dont use them as they are
                    too small and take up too much space to fill orders.Spend Wisely My FriendsBradReply

                    well as all the directions on the ordering page. We are getting stupid
                    fucking emails asking questions you should already know. Do your

                I
                    go to a technical college paid 4 with this cash. So I like this girl I
                    go to school with. I decided she would like me if I protected her. So I
                    started secretly following her home, watching her run in the park, and
                    following her to the grocery store. Then if she got in trouble I could
                    save the day. But the bitch noticed and said I was creepy! All those
                    hours of protection and that’s what I get. I know – such a bitch right?
                    So I decided to be a hero and protect her by watching her while she
                    sleeps from her bedroom window. But this bitch called the cops on me!
                    Money doesnt solve all lifes problems, you’ll still find bitches like
                    this one. This story will have a happy ending though, I’m going to show
                    her my dick while we’re waiting for the class to start. I would love to
                    see boobs, so she would love to see dick. it’s going to be greatReply

                    about a $1000 mixed bills.The cash is beat up like others have commented on but very spendable.I
                    just put my order in for the professional now that I know its legit and I will actually get something.I

                Greetings Guys & GalsFor
                    the fucking complainers out of Asia stop your bitching. Shit happens.
                    We are working on a shipping solution. As soon as we have it I will
                    announce it.As for inventory…….. we are seeing a ton of orders
                    coming in from around the world as bitcoin and other currencies drop in
                    value. Consequently, inventory on all currencies has dropped
                    significantly. GBP is extremely low and we may stop selling it very
                    soon.If order volume continues to be high we may start denying
                    orders. We will only fill orders we can ship. If you email and order and
                    you receive a quote then you are good. However, if you are not sure if
                    you want to order we ask you do not ask for a quote unless you are
                    buying. This way others who really need the cash can get their orders
                    processed. Its the only way we can do it.If you are serious
                    about ordering then get your orders in NOW. We can not guarantee how
                    long we will have enough supply. Please don’t beg and plead for us to
                    fill your order if you miss out.DO NOT BE LEFT BEHIND! ORDER NOWSpend Wisely My FriendsBradReply

                    more good points. Govs are fucking with everything. I thought for sure
                    bitcoin was going to be truly independent of govs policy. Oh well….. so

                As
                    you can see the deep state is working its magic once again. Crypto
                    prices are dropping for one reason only. To stop North Korea. The only
                    way to keep North Korea out of the crypto game was to kill the values.
                    As always the rest of us get caught up as “Casualties of War”The
                    fundamentals of bitcoin remain the same. There is only 21 million ever
                    to be created. Plus all the small players are jumping out providing an

                Unfortunately
                    we have had to suspend deliveries to south east asia. Our contact their
                    has decided to retire from the business. Due to customs processes in
                    Vietnam and Thailand we can not use regular shipping processes.We
                    will make an announcement when we have an alternate solution available.
                    For those of you in the EP program in those countries you regular
                    shipments will not take place until we have a solution.All other shipments and countries are not effected

                The
                    best thing you can do if you comprehend this is not about money. This
                    is about shutting the Federal Reserve down. I will reinvest right back
                    into crypto. Do you see that there can only be a certain amount of cash
                    throughout if you know anything about supply and demand you will
                    understand this group of patriots are not on a main objective to gain
                    monetary paper that of which is right now worthless. This will give
                    everyone a chance to build this money and spend like a normal person
                    just spend at least 2 times but not more than 4 of what you normally do.
                    Destabilize the Jesuit private bank we call Federal Reserve. I cant
                    tell who else it may be or related and controlled by money is a tool
                    that is obsolete. Bitcoin will along with other crypto gain control over
                    the amendment in the executive order has completed its plan. Which
                    paraphrasing is that any enemy of this country Rotschild, Bilderburg,
                    Clinton, Podesta Seth’s murderer by hiring his ms 13 then the rogue ops

                    experience with these guys has been good for the most part. Its not
                    perfect but it does work. I sell weed and other “Party Favors”. I have
                    been doing it for years. Like other businesses I went digital and I only
                    take bitcoin and monero. I use these guys to cash my bitcoin out.
                    Before that I sold it on LBC. But the return I get here is the best.
                    Plus bitcoin can go up and down all it likes. I am not concerned. I set
                    up a company and have cash deposits all the time. No problems at the
                    bank either.I do disagree with their website. They say its
                    “Safe”. Nothing is 100% safe. In the end its stolen money any way you
                    look at it. Just be smart and you will be fine.One more thing.
                    They dont always ship overnight when you order overnight and sometimes
                    you will get less money than you ordered but other times they send more.
                    IDK why maybe they can answer that. Good luck getting random questions
                    answered. They are not real good a quick communication.ReBelReply

                Hello Guys/GalsIt
                    has been a crazy start to 2019. We are swamped with orders. The
                    majority these orders are coming from first time clients. Everyone seems
                    to have a new years resolution to get rich in 2019. Even though these
                    are smaller orders it has drawn down our inventory significantly. I will
                    be adjusting inventory levels to reflect that fact.For 2019 we
                    are updating our site with some new pics. Yeah I know, you been asking
                    for that. Well, your request has not fallen on deaf ears. But, we need
                    your help to do it.We are asking for our customers to send us
                    pics of you receiving your cash and your unpackaging process. Please do
                    not include faces or anything else that would reveal your identity.
                    Anyone who sends us pics will receive 10% off on their next order. If we
                    use your pic for our website we will fill your next order at 50% off.Make
                    sure you tell us a name to use for your pic should it be selected. Be
                    creative, and no real names please. I would prefer not to have a bunch
                    of pics from anonymous. We need every package type, USD, Euro, and GBP
                    from basic to standard, and standard to pro.You can send your pics to us at
                    cashgod@protonmail.com. For the script kiddies who think they are
                    clever we will be opening these attachments in a sterile environment.Change your Fortunes in 2019!Spend

                    elected officials here are millionaires while the rest of us work our
                    asses off just to get by. I was trolling this site for a few weeks now
                    and unsure if I should buy. I am taking back my money from the
                    government the only way I know how. $50,000 ordered with overnight.This is a revolution! I’m tired of

                    if those buyers were real they would have never posted anything about
                    it anyway. All buyers know the rules that come with the cash.The ones that ignore the rules and brag about
                    the pre shred cash are dumb ass noobs anyway.Reply

                I needed a car and used cashgod to make it happen. I did my research before I did anything and it worked
                    out.Here is what I learned:1. I bought the Professional ($10,000)2. Ask for large bills.3.
                    Buy your car (used) at auction.4. Make sure the out the door price is less than $10,0005. Per IRS
                    guidelines any transaction in cash $10,000 or higher has to be reported.6. I paid $8,300 for my car after fees
                    and taxes.I
                    know its not as glorious as to what some other people are doing here
                    but I did get a good deal. I paid $1250 to buy the Professional and
                    ended up with a car that’s worth about $9,000 if I sold it to a private
                    seller.Reply

            JOEJanuary 12, 2019 at 5:09 am
                I
                    have finished some research regarding a particular group who is making
                    there presence known on the dark-net. They have sent several demands for
                    100 BTC or they will take down several of the most popular dark web
                    vendors. They have going after Brad and his team for a couple of
                    months. They threaten to “destroy market confidence” and “make sure no
                    one will do business with you again”. So you may have noticed many false
                    negative reviews around forums and other places.I must say this
                    group is sophisticated. They have been able to use bots to post several
                    thousand random posts on various clear-net and dark-net boards
                    discouraging people from doing business with cashgod. After
                    additional research I can confirm this same group cloned cashgod and
                    renamed it cashCompany.PsyOps is nothing new but this group
                    shows signs of gov backing. Either its our “Cousins” with “Christians in
                    Action” or its another player such as North Korea. My initial thoughts
                    steer me toward North Korea. It makes sense that they would attempt to
                    extort bitcoin from Brad and his team, clone cashgod, create a new
                    site called cash Company, and then scam those customers who visit their
                    site. The timing of incidents correlate.Its no secret that
                    various USA based agencies have been using PsyOps to scare prospective
                    buyers and attempt to close down cashgod, perhaps to varying
                    success. However, it usually is not typical for them to use extortion in
                    these cases. The USA agencies have plenty of money to work with whereas
                    North Korea does not.My best advice to people reading this is
                    remember that any public forum can and is used to perform PsyOps.
                    Deepdotweb is a haven for gov agencies. They used it to steer people to a
                    very popular market place which was being run my the Dutch government
                    using positive feedback to lure people in.I know JC and others
                    have recommended going private, as existing clients already know the
                    legitimacy of Brad and his team and receive product regularly. I can
                    only say this; The more you limit your sale of pre-shred cash to the
                    public the more the gov agencies as well as extortion groups win the
                    war. I suggest Brad, you do not give in. Will there be people who will
                    be scared away and not get the pre-shred cash, yes, but there are others
                    who will push past the rhetoric and stand up to the gov and rightfully
                    take back the cash the gov has stolen from them for years.JOEReply

                    distribution into the public making it harder for any one person to get

                Notes for newbies & first timers1.) Read the entire order processing TWICE before asking questions to
                    Brad and his team2.)
                    Buy a little more than the quoted price to account for transfer fees
                    (min $100 extra). For the $5000 (standard) which costs $750, buy $850
                    worth of BTC. The price they quote you at is the price you pay
                    regardless of BTC goes up/down3.) When sending the BTC to the wallet
                    address and calculate a fee that will transfer quickly usually ~30 min.
                    (I didn’t do this and it took 13+ hrs to confirm the transaction. You
                    will end up having to send them an email and your order could
                    potentially get cancelled)4.) I recommend purchasing the overnight or the fastest shipping available to you.5.)
                    Like it’s been stated, do NOT deposit or make purchases in excess of
                    $10,000. Person to person transactions should be okay (buying a used car
                    from a person) but depositing/purchasing anything that has the
                    potential to leave a paper trail (banks, stores, etc) is obviously
                    stupid.Reply

                    if the bills are real or counterfeit. I am unable to tell the difference.Please only respond if you
                    actually ordered.Reply

                    you should not be depositing $15k all at one time. If you read any of
                    the forums you should know that. Yes, you fucked up big time. Walking
                    away and making a big deal of it did not help you either.Listen
                    people, DO NOT DEPOSIT MORE THAN $10,000 ON THE SAME DAY! Even better,
                    wait at least a week between deposits. Depositing on Fridays is
                    preferable since its Pay Day for most people. Its not unusual for people
                    to be depositing cash.Reply

                The bank is telling me I have to fill out a form to make a $15,000 deposit. I told them “No”. Am I going to have
                    problems?Reply

                    shit. I made a small order to see whats what and you came through. I am
                    going to do a much larger order. Dont fuck me and you will have a very

                UPDATES!!!New
                    inventory is in !!! Our first batch of 2019! I will be adjusting
                    inventory levels to reflect the fact. GBP customers we are still low on
                    GBP and will likely be so until late next week. USD and EURO are back to
                    good levels.If we get another email from a fucktard asking for
                    instructions on how to order I am going to go insane. Read the fucking
                    website. If you are illiterate or unable to follow instructions then you
                    were likely destined to be poor because managing large amounts of money
                    is impossible for you.Reminder, to please make sure you tell us
                    in your email that you want cash shipped internationally. Otherwise you
                    will get the wrong quote and your shipment will be delayed.For
                    you first timers do not give us a fake address. Its stupid and all it
                    does is prevent you from getting your cash. We do not put a return
                    address if your cash cant be delivered to you. All that does is make
                    Fedex richer and they have enough fucking money.Spend Wisely My FriendsBradReply

                Any
                    suggestions on how to buy BTC with the most stealth? Since the new
                    largest package is now $10k I feel like that would raise an eyebrow or
                    two if I came to Wells Fargo every 2 weeks with that kind of cash to
                    exchange for BTC. Thanks!Reply

                So
                    I am a first time customer and bought the 10k deal. Most of the cash I
                    got was in 20’s. I am trying to convert my cash into my local currency.
                    The guy at the exchange said he doesn’t buy 20’s only 100’s. I guess I
                    will order 100’s with my next order.Brad have you heard of anything like this before?Reply

                    a sealed mylar bag. I got some scissors opened up the bag and YESSSS
                    cash all 20’s. I used my counterfeit pen and ultraviolet light on the
                    bills. They are real. I can feel the raised print as well. VERY NICE.I will be ordering again after my 2

                    Hate to break it to but your her bitch. You need to put her in her
                    place with a few open handed strikes. She’ll never learn if you don’t
                    put some power behind them to make it memorable. After 5-10 minutes of
                    this you say “Honey I love you, and YOU made me do this to you, I didn’t
                    want to, and its your fault.” Trust me son, this is the only way she’ll
                    learn to obey your command in the home.Reply

                    last package I got (5,000 EURO) was short 200. Its not a really big deal
                    but at the same time thats my money and I want it. I emailed you asking
                    for you to mail the remaining 200 but you said you’ll include it in
                    your next order. Kind of upset about it but I guess 4,800 is still good.Reply

                Happy New Year My Fellow Rebels!Its
                    officially 2019 and it is going to be an incredible year. We are going
                    on 2 years in business which is ancient for the darknet. The last 2
                    weeks of the month were crazy busy many of our large clients were
                    laundering cash and we had several new customers who found wealth in
                    bitcoin and were looking for a better return using us to move their coin
                    to cash. All of our inventory levels are low. However we are expecting
                    to replenish our inventory this week.Spend Wisely My FriendsBradReply

                    of the cash I got was in good shape but a few $20’s didn’t go through
                    the ATM. I emailed mr Brad about it and said he sent me replacements
                    today. Its weird to have decent customer service on the dark net. Most
                    vendors are faggots. Lets see if the replacements really come thoughNow
                    I have to wait a week and a half before I can order another package.
                    Brad any chance you’ll relax that “You can only order every 2 weeks”

                I
                    have had to put two orders on hold because I’m having the worst time
                    trying to buy bitcon. One place is frozen and I can’t find too many.
                    They must think I’m a weird. I swear I will order soon, I just need to
                    figure out the bitcon and a good wallet.Thanks.Reply

                Hey
                    So I got your cash and deposited it in the bank, but I’m worrying that
                    the bank lady is going to call the FBI. She was looking at me
                    suspiciously when I deposited $5,000 cash. I joked with her I got it
                    selling drugs but she should know that was a joke right.Reply

                I
                    read a lot of negative shit about this place when doing my research
                    (despite that I still ordered…I know I know) I did the bare minimum they
                    would sell me which was 1300 bucks and I paid $325. As soon as I hit
                    send from my bitcoin wallet I felt a pit in my stomach that I probably
                    wont see the that money again.Oh.. I ordered last week btw on
                    wednesday. I never did get a confirmation number or anything. I even
                    sent a couple of emails and no response. I figured.. fucked again and
                    learned yet another lesson.Fast forward to this evening around
                    6. The door bell rings and its fedex with a delivery. It was from some
                    media company in fresno CA. I looked at the name and it was the fake one
                    I gave when I ordered from cashgod. Again, I was a skeptic and
                    figured there is probably a pile of shit inside the box or at least a
                    picture of someone flipping me off. I opened it and inside a 2 DVD’s,
                    brand new (Armageddon & Sphere). I remember reading in the forums
                    people getting DVD’s with cash inside so I opened it up and inside no
                    DVD’s but a mylar bag sealed shut. Inside the mylar bad was all 100
                    dollar bills. $1700 and not the $1300 I ordered.I am not sure
                    why all the bad press. Maybe its because they dont email fast. I am not
                    sure. I am starting to believe what others have told me that maybe
                    police or something are posting negative stuff in order to frighten
                    people away. All I know is I not only got cash but more than I paid for.
                    I am really happy about that.Now I understand why the gov wants
                    to shut these guys down. If they are getting this money the way they
                    say they are,then they are really screwing over the fed. Well I guess
                    good for us. I can only speak to my experience and say I paid for cash
                    and I got cash.My lesson from this experience, sometimes things
                    are what they say they are. I hope you find this informative and it
                    helps you in making an informed decision.Reply

                    need it. So, I guess its ok. I pay taxes that the government misspends
                    on stupid stuff anyway. Thats me rationalizing out loud making

                The
                    US is not so innocent. Look, the fact is the odds are stacked against
                    us. Wall Street and a few elite have control of the money system and we
                    are so stupid to believe in it. Listen people get your head out of your
                    ass and stop the rat race you are in. How hard do you work everyday just
                    to get a few slips of paper that a government says is worth something.
                    Actually, now you dont even get paper. Its just numbers in a computer
                    system. In the end this will all go to shit.Reply

                Like
                    many people I was skeptical when I saw this site. Cheap cash, real cash
                    and not counterfeit. It seemed like a dream come true. I ordered the
                    25k deal. I know, probably not the smartest thing to do, I should have
                    tested it with $1300. I thought to myself that if its real then I need
                    as much as I can get.My Experience:$25,000 Order on 12-7-17Received Tracking Number from Fedex
                    in 2-3 hoursOrder Arrived 12-12-17Large Box with Xbox 360 InsideNow
                    I was a little confused here. I wasn’t sure why I was getting an Xbox
                    360 and at first I was pissed. I thought I had been had. I then remember
                    someone writing on these forums that they received cash inside a VCR or
                    something. So I open the Xbox 360 and inside was my money. They took
                    all the insides out and shrink wrapped the money.I counted the money and it was exactly $25,000
                    (Unfortunately no extra like others had experienced)I used my counterfeit pen and checked the currency
                    none were counterfeit.I
                    hope this helps. There was a lot of ups and downs ordering this. I
                    never bought anything online like this. Now I am glad I did and will buy
                    again.Reply

                    it look like the USA futures markets are trading Bitcoin contracts. I
                    knew at some point these greedy banks were going to get involved and try
                    to manipulate the price of Bitcoin. It wont happen. I think the banks
                    have met their match with Bitcoin. Immediately the price went us 22%
                    after the debut of the futures contracts. HAHAHA! Short sellers are not
                    their even though the “Fake News” says they are. More bullshit from the

                    was packaged very well. The cash was vacuum sealed inside a

                I
                    been a criminal my whole life and this is by far the best shit I ever
                    heard of in my life… I’m new to this bitcoin stuff and I’m trying to
                    make this a way of living and after seeing the comments, I know this is
                    official… Maybe the most official thing you can do on here period, if
                    you guys want bitcoins and I want money… It’s a win, win situation!

                Hi Guys & GalsWe
                    had a hiccup with our systems this week which delayed responses for new
                    orders. There was no impact to existing orders and those of you who get
                    regular EP shipments. If you were impacted, sorry about that. Its fixed
                    now and we fired the guy who fucked it up.If you are looking to
                    get cash for the upcoming holidays I suggest you do it now. Last year
                    at this time we were slammed. We will keep send cash as long as we have
                    the inventory, first come, first served.Also Bitcoin has really
                    moved over the past 2 weeks. If you bought in prior now is the time to
                    leverage that. You will be able to get more cash for your coin using or
                    services. Take advantage of it while you can. Odds are Bitcoin will be
                    moving lower to make a correction soon!As a reminder, we suggest
                    that you deposit less than 10,000 per week into your accounts or just
                    spend the cash. Do not do something stupid and attract attention. Having
                    money comes responsibility. You can get really wealth very fast as many
                    of our customers have. If you are uncomfortable with getting stolen
                    cash then I suggest you at least pay off your debts so that you are not a
                    slave to the fucking banks.Be Smart & Spend Wisely My FriendsBradPlease
                    be mindful of scam sites. There are many only use products from the
                    hidden wiki and make sure when you communicate with us its to our
                    cashgod@protonmail.com email address.Reply

                    dont know what Ace would say, but I suggest you dont deposit more than
                    5k in a 3 day period. I dont know how much you have but you dont want to
                    put attention on yourself. The law is 10k in any 24 hour period, but I
                    like to be conservative.Reply

                    not sure what you are. I did get my box of cash and it passed the
                    counterfeit tests I used. However, it was supposed to be overnight and
                    it took 3 days. Not sure why. I emailed about the issue and I never got a
                    response. I am considering another order but I hope the service is a
                    little bit better. The product is great.Reply

                Less
                    than $3,000 in the ATM’s you might be able to do more but I am super
                    careful. If you keep your orders in a schedule you can easily deposit
                    enough that will show the large deposits as normal. I would only go
                    higher after than but never more than $10,000 in a week.Reply

                    dont think Bitcoin is going anywhere. It is a bunch of hype for
                    nothing. Though it is smart to get cash to keep in your house or some
                    place safe other than a bank. Governments all over the world are corrupt
                    and they play with your life savings like its a game.Reply

                    got my package yesterday from Fedex. I had it shipped right to my

                    will be ordering as soon as i get some bitcoin i am still very
                    skeptical about buying from the DW since i have been scammed like 5
                    times already but i really hope that cashgod is different but there
                    are so many good reviews on here that i am pretty sure they are legit
                    and are not going to disappoint fingers crossed i will update you guys

                BradYou
                    guys are the best source to sell bitcoin to. Now that it is over 11k I
                    want to buy a few 50k packages. You have the cheapest money on that I
                    can find. Would you consider removing the 2 week requirement between
                    orders so that we take advantage of this current bitcoin market? It is
                    not going to last and this is a rare opportunity.Reply

                I am a regular customer here and now get regular shipments every two weeks. It has changed my life.The
                    real scammers are the government. Many countries used to be on the gold
                    standard. Meaning for every dollar printed the government held one
                    dollar worth of gold in its reserve. Now the government doesn’t use that
                    standard and they just print money with nothing backing it. A dollar
                    bill is worth a dollar only because the government says it is.Guys
                    like cashgod are fucking around with their system. I am sure they
                    are going after them with everything they got with fake reviews and DOS
                    attacks etc. Of course they cant find them via tor so they do the next
                    best thing and try to scare people into not buying the pre shred cash.Look
                    people the government has fucked us over and big banks and greedy
                    politicians have taken over by tweaking the system in their favor. The
                    team at cashgod has evened the score and let us have our money back.
                    The money belongs to the people. Plus, you could make much better use
                    of the money than your government.Just my two micro bits for what its worth.Reply

                    might be in the minority, but I hope people read those fake negative
                    reviews and stay away from here. The less people who know about it the

                Hello Good PeopleIt
                    has been a VERY busy week. Most people wanted overnight in time for
                    Black Friday. I assume to do holiday shopping in the USA. The orders
                    have brought our USD inventory down but we still have plenty for
                    additional orders. We also have refreshed our GBP inventory for our UK
                    clients.Once again a reminder for international orders. You need
                    to tell us when you make your order that you want the cash shipped
                    internationally. Otherwise your quote will not be correct and IT WILL
                    DELAY YOUR SHIPMENT!As many of you know we have debated whether
                    or not to go private and stop accepting new orders. As opposed to doing
                    that we are going to change the Elite Program membership. We are only
                    going to be accepting a few new members and we are likely to be changing
                    our membership requirements, essentially making it more difficult to
                    join. Those changes will be announced in the next few weeks.Last
                    thing, READ THE WEBSITE… We get lots of emails where people are asking
                    questions that are already answered on our website. We are going to stop
                    responding to those emails. This is cheap cash and a quick way to
                    really change your financial situation. Do yourself a favor and pay
                    attention. If we get one more email asking if this is counterfeit I am
                    going to puke! WE DO NOT DEAL IN COUNTERFEIT. ONLY REAL CASH!Spending Wisely My Friends,BradReply

                    disappointed with the process, I’ve ordered it 2 times so far. I dont
                    care if they are getting the cash from aliens, chinese, indians, the FED
                    or where ever else. This deposits into an ATM and bank tellers have no

                    “looking for money” its legit but they sure do take a while. It
                    sometimes takes 24-48 hours for them to respond. Sometimes it takes 2
                    days to get their “Overnight” packages. Kind of shady if you ask me.

                    Brad, I ordered the 1,300 on Oct 12th, then $10,000 on Nov 1st. I had
                    no issues with either order. If I do a youtube review can I get 10% off
                    of your pro package?Reply

                I
                    am really happy I found this place. I paid for 10k. This will be a
                    great way to get my holiday shopping out of the way. My family is going
                    to have one hell of a holiday now. I hope it gets here before Friday.
                    10k can buy me a lot of deals.Reply

                I
                    am an EP member here and have buying Euros from them for awhile. My
                    recommendation is to not try to buy that much. Plus SW does not offer
                    that large of an amount as far as I know.EU regulators are
                    watching accounts also, not only in the USA. If you are depositing the
                    money keep the amounts low. If you are smart you can keep using this
                    resource and make a lot of money.Reply

                    is completely worth it in every way shape and form. After the first
                    package I am hooked and buy as much as I can every time. cashgod
                    takes 2+ days to ship sometimes longer so buy as much as you can. I also
                    think their going to get busted at some point. They also make you wait 2
                    weeks to order again. Booooooo!Reply

                Hi Guys/GalsFinally
                    some good news for our European clients, we made a deal with our
                    “vendor” so the Euro inventory will be going back up. I know many of you
                    were waiting until that issue was resolved before ordering. Order up we
                    are ready for you.Fucking scammers are out in full force now as
                    we head into the USA holiday season. We are seeing more clones then
                    ever. We have evidence that a large amount of it is state sponsored but
                    there are a few script kiddies out there looking for quick cash.BE
                    CAREFUL and make sure that every page you are on is cashgod
                    http://cashgodplzcfmasy.onion Some of the script kiddies out there are
                    not even bothering to change the site just the email address. Only send
                    emails to cashgod@protonmail.com anywhere else and you are NOT
                    TALKING TO US.We are working hard to take down clones. We have
                    code that has worked well in helping us identify people who steal our
                    site. We already found one dickhead in India. Dont worry we left him
                    alone but his family ran into some problems. Lets just say he is done
                    fucking around with us.I am getting a lot of questions about how
                    we get our cash and how to use it. All of these questions are answered
                    on our site. Its easy money people READ READ READ. Dont be lazy!A
                    few final thoughts…………… The US elections have brought to light the use
                    of state sponsored misinformation “Fake News” this is something most of
                    us in the darknet knew about for years. I can tell you personally that
                    gov agencies are trying VERY VERY HARD to bring us down but the
                    technology makes it difficult for them. They use “Fake News” to sour our
                    reputation and now they are stepping up clones and screwing over our
                    customers in order to discredit us. We will not let it stop us!Our
                    goal since day 1 has been clear. The 1% has taken advantage of us for
                    too long. Now the 99% is getting their deserved share. Get yours.
                    Nothing good lasts forever. Do not miss out, but be cautious.BradReply

                    think its drug money because its in GOOD shape. I thought this was cash
                    selected for disposal? The cash works in ATM’s but I think there is
                    something very fishy going on. personally I think these guys may be the

                Single
                    dad here with 2 very young children. This seems like a dream come true
                    to fix my immediate financial issues. But as a single father it’s scary
                    to do something like this because if I were to get into trouble… I worry
                    about my kids. But really, it just seems like selling bitcoin for more
                    than the going price. And there is no law against that, only that we are
                    knowingly receiving stolen property.If they setup a second,
                    fake website that doesn’t say the money is stolen, it could just be a
                    front saying that they buy bitcoins for above market value, then anyone
                    caught could say they were just selling bitcoins on this website that
                    shows nothing about it being stolen. Just an idea.The casino
                    idea is great. Just put a hundred or so into a machine, play a few
                    spins, print your ticket, go to another machine, repeat.. At the end, go
                    to one of the atm’s that take your tickets and cash out. So you may
                    lose $50 out of $1000, still making a profit and still getting back
                    fresh bills to ease your mind about putting them in the bank. Not to
                    mention the slot machines are a great test of the bills to show they are
                    real.Anyway, I am going to give it a shot and just buy the $350
                    package and see how it goes. If it goes well, i’ll wait the 2 weeks and
                    grab the big package (not my dick), and fix all my financial problems.Reply

                Ok, I received my first shipment from these guys. Here is my review.Order: $10,000 Express ShippingPaid:
                    $1,250 (Paid in Equivalent Bitcoin)Tracking Received: 18 Hours (I did order on a Sunday)Package Delivered:
                    4 days from paymentShipping Method: FedexShipping Quality: Standard. Used DVD Cases with Cash Inside.Product
                    Quality: Real USA notes 100 & 20. Pen tested and pro-grade machine counter with counterfeit detection
                    capabilityOverall
                    Review: Not bad. These guys definitely got their hands on real cash. I
                    can see no reason not to be able to spend it or deposit it as they
                    described. Though I have not deposited the money at a bank. I have no
                    intention of doing so.Vendor Rating: BReason: They ship what
                    they advertise and the stealth shipping method is good. Product was
                    delivered on time, but email response can be slow. Otherwise they would
                    have earned an A.I hope this helps.8Reply

                I
                    totally forgot fedex delivered on saturday. Got my package yesterday I
                    just thought it would come monday. I guess i spaced it when I looked at
                    the tracking. It was a $2,500 package the bills are in “Good” condition,
                    spendable but not new and crisp.Reply

                    bought the $2500 one, will I have any problems depositing the entire
                    amount or do I need to do smaller amounts? Please help..I want to stay
                    safe.Reply

                Well
                    said Cage! I think that’s why we are here. This is the best kept secret

                That’s
                    the truth Brad! Fucking Europeans they just want to take take take. I
                    hope it works out. The government is in full blown denial now. We now
                    have proof Russia was putting out all kinds of fake news on twitter and
                    Facebook. Its all a bunch of bullshit! The government does the same shit
                    with SW, lot of “unhappy customers”. What bull shit is that. This place
                    has changed the way I live and a few others I know. Just another reason
                    to go private Brad. I have been pushing for it for quite awhile now.
                    Why deal with all the fake bullshit. Fake News, Fake Reviews, the
                    government stooges are going to do all they can to stop you from giving
                    out the stolen pre-shred cash. They are the fucking crooks and they know
                    it. God bless TOR it works and keeps those greedy bastards at bay!JCReply

                Thanks
                    for the update Brad. You guys are really cool dont let anyone stop
                    you. It feels good to finally have money I have been down and out for
                    too long!Long live the revolution!Reply

                Guys/GalsIt
                    has been a VERY BUSY week. I am happy to announce that our new supplier
                    of GBP got a really good exchange rate to replenish our GBP inventory.
                    We have had lots of happy “mates” who have or will soon be getting some
                    well reserved cash. Are you?As always I like to be transparent
                    with you on the business front. Our supplier in Europe wants to
                    renegotiate our agreement early and has decided to go on strike until we
                    work it out. They have agreed to ship out the existing inventory but
                    they will not exchange our USD for Euro until we agree on new terms. I
                    am pissed beyond belief but we will work it out. No honor among thieves!
                    That is the lesson of the day. As soon as I have an update I will let
                    you know. In the meantime, I updated our inventory for Euro to low just
                    to be cautious.A few other notes… USA clients make sure you are
                    not depositing more than $10,000 at any one time. Do NOT go to different
                    banks to make smaller deposits, you will still get flagged for the
                    deposits since the fucking government tracks by ss#. We did have one
                    client email us that he screwed up and now he got an letter from the
                    State because of back child support. Look, if you are not used to having
                    money then you need to get smart quick. Being wealthy is NOT easy.
                    Everyone including the government is going to want a piece. Dont be
                    stingy but dont be cheap either!Enjoy the week and the cash! Fuck the Government Crooks!!!!BradReply

                Hi
                    all, just testing if this is legit. Is there anyone from uk who has
                    ordered? These get rich quick things have never really worked for me so I
                    don’t want to lose what little I have. If I loose or get scammed, this
                    would really put me in the mud so I’m looking to see how many would
                    respond to get an idea if this is legit. I apologise if this is
                    offensive but it would reassure me to order. ThanksReply

                    know it sounds too good to be true…. and I thought the same way until I
                    tried it. This is the real deal! The cash is confirmed legit and not
                    counterfeit. That is a big deal because these guys are the only ones
                    SELLING REAL CASH.I received my first order last week. Unfortunately, they make you wait between orders
                    for 2 weeks.Reply

                Good
                    product for the money. Easy to spend and deposit, a decent vendor. The
                    website is a little weak. The response time is slow. It does not appear
                    brand new.Avoid the temptation to spend all the money at once. They
                    seriously will only send you 1 order every 2 weeks. it is a real pain
                    waiting around until you can order again. I got it right away with
                    overnight shipping. Why only 4 of 5 stars? slow response time.Reply

                    is it when a customer asks for special amount of bills and doesn’t get
                    it? I asked for all 100’s and you send me all 20’s. The package could
                    have been so much smaller if you used all 100’s like I asked.Reply

                    guys, i want to order, but i am very skeptical, because i never bought
                    something from dark net… this sounds too nice to be true. Sometimes i
                    think the owner of this page write the positive comments by their own.
                    Dont know, so can anyone help? :)… If I order and i am wrong or my
                    thoughts were wrong, I will apologize Brad. We all need money, but real
                    money for less money sounds too good…Reply

                I
                    suggest anyone outside the USA use local currency exchange places. They
                    ask very little questions and if you exchange a few thousand at a time
                    you stay under the radar. I have exchanged $25,000 and spread it out
                    over 6 different locations.Reply

                    wilson signed the federal reserve act and afterwards he admitted that
                    he knowingly doomed future Americans and their financial stability you
                    see when Woodrow Wilson was a professor she had a affair and the powers
                    that be behind the federal reserve blackmailed him afraid of his affair
                    being exposed Wilson agreed and signed the federal reserve act into law
                    and it passed with only 4 votes because all other senators congressmen

                    experience here was bittersweet. I bought to Professional for $10k and
                    everything went ok. I deposited it the bank and a few days later I get a
                    letter from the state that they were notified of unusual deposit
                    history from my bank. The bastards are all over me for back child
                    support and now its frozen and they are likely going to just take it.My
                    suggestion is to not bother depositing the money and only spend it as
                    cash. Especially if you are in the same situation as I am with child

                Why
                    do you have a once per month policy? I want to order more cash too. It
                    seems like others want the policy changed also. It might be a good idea
                    to let us order earlier.Reply

                    now I need a plan on how to deal with a large amount of cash. Its more

                    very good points. No one said it was easy in the darknet. Im still
                    using my cash from here to buy gold and bitcoin, but mostly gold. The
                    world is going into the shitter. I dont want to left holding a bag of
                    worthless paper money, plus if we lose power and technology bitcoin will
                    be worthless. That leaves good ole shinny gold. Its always had value

                Those
                    of you who have been around SW for while know me. I have been saying to
                    be careful of the type of research you do about darknet sites. Reddit,
                    Google, YouTube, are NOT credible resources. LE and even larger groups
                    like our family at Christians in Action are responsible for a
                    considerable amount of Psych Ops against illegal operations.Hansa
                    Market is a good example, once compromised by the Dutch government
                    several thousand positive fake reviews went up everywhere (Reddit,
                    Google, YouTube, etc) Then they sat back and recorded everything that
                    took place and several of the vendors went down hard. Marketplaces are
                    not as safe as everyone touts them to be and many legit independents
                    (like cashgod) are known by the true players in the darknet. I say
                    this again as a reminder, negative reviews of a website mean nothing.
                    Its the sites with many positive reviews or none at all that should
                    concern you, especially if they are for illegal activities but posted on
                    clearnet sites like Google ,YouTube, and unfortunately now even Reddit.Rule
                    #1 of true darknet proprietors is that you dont advertise in the
                    clearnet, ever. It compromises anonymity. Plus true darknet vendors, at
                    least ones worth doing business with, have established customers and do
                    not need to “advertise” in the traditional sense of the word. Their
                    marketing is usually tied to word of mouth advertising or chain
                    messaging on trusted relay points like THW (the real one
                    zqktlwi4fecvo6ri.onion) and they usually change onion addresses and
                    servers on a regular basis for security reasons.Take a look…. Its about this topic but focuses on Opioid
                    sales but the practice is know to be used in all areas.https://www.deepdotweb.com/2018/08/29/law-enforcement-leave-fake-negative-reviews-disrupt-darknet-markets/Stay

                Be
                    careful!!! Like some others that commented here I was scammed by clones
                    as well. cashgod is pretty famous in the underground world but as a
                    noob I didnt know any better.Brad and his team are fantastic.
                    They helped me overcome my fear and distrust since getting screwed twice
                    before with cloned sites. I did my homework this time and researched
                    with TRUSTED darkweb veterans who know what is what around here and they
                    gave me the correct http://cashgodplzcfmasy.onion
                    cashgod address. I have made sure to keep this link bookmarked so
                    that I am not fooled again. There are so many clones out their its hard
                    to know what is real or not. All I can tell you is do your research
                    (which is hard) with people who REALLY KNOW the darkweb. Its not as easy
                    as it seems.BTW.. the money you get from these guys is not
                    counterfeit. It is real cash, like others I tested it for counterfeit
                    and used a pro grade counter, every bill passed and as others have
                    commented their stealth shipping is insane!Thanks BradAB Lives!Reply

                    hard to get this site down. But yeah, like I say live-and-let-live. What

                    will probably be an odd post but I hope these guys approve it. Here is
                    my story, I have been using this group to get cash for a around a month.
                    I used the cash to pay off my credit cards. I am debt free which is
                    nice and I am not complaining.BUT– You will get addicted to the
                    money. I have already noticed my spending is WAY UP from what I used to
                    do. I understand now what people say that money does not make you happy.
                    I need to reign in my spending again. I was addicted to the credit
                    cards before now its the cash. Either way I was addicted. I need to kick
                    the habit and spend like a normal human being.KayReply

                Good
                    news for our “Mates” across the pond! We have secured a new source for
                    GBP within the UK and received confirmation that inventory is in place .
                    For our UK clients, current and new, thank you for your patience as we
                    secured a new contractor to handle our “currency needs”. You are free to
                    start your GBP orders. Orders today will go out as early as tomorrow.On
                    a separate note USD inventory is low. For whatever reason we received
                    several large orders over the past few days. Those are shipping out
                    today. Unfortunately it placed a strain on USD inventory, however we are
                    expecting more USD later this week. Until then all USD orders will be
                    processed in the order they are received. For our Elite Program clients
                    there will be no issues with your regular bi-weekly delivery. Your cash
                    has already been moved aside to fill your orders.If you are
                    waiting on tax reform or thinking your government is going to fix things
                    dont hold your breath. I can tell you they are so screwed up nothing
                    will change. We built an entire business on their lack of discipline and
                    poor controls. The money belongs to the people the government took it

                    But that is not unusual, there have been several attempts where people
                    cloned this site and try to screw cashgod customers. There was one a
                    few weeks ago and I feel sorry for that poor bastard who cloned this
                    site. I know they found out who the guy was who did it. Some Arab or
                    something. All I know is I would not want to be that shit head. These

                We ship worldwide with the exception of Cuba and North Korea.Also,
                    a note regarding our international orders. You must tell us that the
                    shipment is international when you request your quote. All orders not
                    shipped to a EU address is an international order. If you dont tell us
                    we do not add it to your quote. When you send payment then tell us you
                    want it sent internationally we can not ship until you pay the
                    international shipping.This has been happening a lot lately and it
                    delays your shipment. I want these orders to be shipped within 24 hours
                    but we cant do that if you do not pay for international shipping
                    upfront.BradReply

                    I had trouble with so far is unpacking the Euro from the very strong
                    packaging. I needed a knife to open it, but I cut some of the bills.

                    the beginning of this year, I’ve been wanting to try this cash. As
                    usual, I spent around 2 weeks thinking about it before I spent any
                    money. After placing my order the package came with a great speed and
                    low price. Absolutely love it, because it is so simply, and it gives you
                    the feel of being rich.The pros in this product were: Low Price, fast shipping.The negatives are: having
                    to figure out bitcoin to make the purchase.Reply

                    Do not deposit more than 10k at one time. Otherwise you are asking for
                    trouble. Plus if you have an average daily balance in your account of
                    something like $1000 then depositing 25k at one time is going to raise
                    some concerns.Stay off their radar!Reply

                    factory mistakes or pen marks. The box was a little damaged because of
                    the USPS shipping option, but I love the free shipping options. Expect
                    2-4 days for the 2-3 day shipping. Been 6 days since I got my last

                I
                    think it’s a good idea in the long term Brad. In my opinion it would
                    be cool to give new people a little time to try it out first, or only
                    offer one package size to non members and make it more
                    complicated/anonymous. Example – have the orders pre-packed (don’t give
                    them selection to choose note type) and just have a basic webpage layout
                    for non members. That way only members can see the process of how the
                    money is obtained (though most already know).So maybe switch to
                    an invite only service in the future for new customers but if you ever
                    need to re-open or want to expand you could always remove the invite
                    code.Reply

                Brad
                    I must say I think for the safety of you a and your organization, as
                    well as to keep helping the community you already have: without getting
                    to the point where you start getting huge fed attention – it’s probably a
                    good idea. I’m new here just placed my first order and hope I can be
                    part of the family. If you decide to go private, I sincerely hope you
                    give the people (like me) who just found this place the opportunity to
                    do business and would like to be a part of the club =).I used to
                    know people in the online AAS community (steroid/anabolics online
                    vendors) and I know how the top vendors got shutdown. I also know the
                    ones who are still operating to this day and have been for many years
                    (10+ yrs). I’ll send an email if you’d like some tips please read I’ll

                    did business with these guys in July buying the Basic pack. I thought
                    for sure they would be shut down. The money was the real deal. I order
                    the Pro pack for next week. Still nervous about it I dont want to press

                First order here. Anyways testing to see if my comment posts again I’m super excited !!Tips
                    on how to spend money. Never deposit more than 10k at a bank but in all
                    honesty even if you deposit less you might still cause the bank to be
                    suspicious. Depending on your income and bank size of course. But I’d
                    personally stick to using the cash primarily for gas, groceries, and
                    other necessities. Give to family in small amounts and donate to
                    charities =) make the world a better place. If we all spent even just a
                    small percentage of our income giving to others – it would make a huge
                    impact on people of the world. That’s my goal in life. My goal isn’t to
                    have a mansion and Ferrari’s. I just want to help others. Of course
                    having a steady home and wealth for rainy days is nice, but eventually
                    I’ll work up to that.Advice – buy a non suspicious car such as a few
                    years old Hyundai or Toyota or truck/suv. Don’t try to buy anything
                    worth more than a few grand with cash at a time. Build a small business
                    (ebay/amazon/pizzeria/carwash etc) generate a legitimate income source.
                    Pay your taxes. Don’t go from 35k a year to 200k a year. Slowly work
                    your way up. Report bitcoin income to IRS. try to make as many
                    deductions as possible (this will make you look like you are trying to
                    save/make more money, not hide/launder).Take your time with your
                    business and work on side projects that will be legitimate deposits to
                    your bank without raising any eyebrows by the gov.Get burner laptops and phones!! Never use same aliases or
                    real phone # with darkweb. Be smart and cautious!!Reply

                    is here but it smells like fish or something. Where you do you keep the
                    money? My package of 5k was mostly 20s and 100s. Decent condition. Like
                    others have said the bills are worn down some have stamps from
                    different places, some have writing. There are a few of the 100s that
                    are torn alot of them are 96 series bills that were going to be traded
                    out I would imagine.Overall I am happy with the experience. I will order again.Reply

                    Helix. I went a little short the first time I tried paying. Thankfully
                    they were understanding and let me send the remaining amount to another

                    I am happy to see you are under new management. Things were getting a
                    bit slow over the past few months! Nice to see you guys bouncing back!Reply

                Good
                    product for the money. Easy to spend and deposit, a decent vendor. The
                    website is a little weak. The response time is slow. It does not appear
                    brand new.Avoid the temptation to spend all the money at once. They
                    seriously will only send you 1 order per month. it is a real pain
                    waiting around until you can order again. I got it right away with
                    overnight shipping. Why only 4 of 5 stars? slow response time.Reply

                    deadline focused. The cash delivery was on time and they are easy to
                    work with. I think he could improve on responding to messages faster. I

                    meets my expectations. It remains to be seen how long I will be able to
                    order cash from this group. the cash does not concern me, they sell
                    alot and I trust them. The only other thing I would have like to see is
                    different packing options. Like being able to have the cash packaged
                    inside of a fishing rod or something. I will update if I notice any

                I
                    love money. Love. I would rather have money than sex. I bought this as a
                    treat for myself. Skillfully hid the box from my husband and children
                    when they were delivered today. Could not wait for them to get in bed
                    fast enough. Opened it up…and i felt like I was floating on clouds I was
                    so happy. I pull out a few $100’s, rub them over my body and it’s
                    orgasmic. I’m so sad b/c I was looking forward to ordering a big package
                    this week but I realized they have a limit on 1 shipment per monthReply

                    previously, I knew the quality. Needless to say the cash lived up to my

                So
                    to start this review off, This cash is definitely not remotely as crisp
                    and brand new as the photos show. I would say they are all >B<
                    quality. That was a main concern for me before I bought this cash. Now
                    there was a lot of positive review for this organization when I was
                    considering buying from them, so I figured I would give it a shot;
                    especially since it is for a good price and has free shipping.I’ve
                    ordered a few packages and they can be very tightly packaged or pretty
                    large, depending on what you request. Not many people realize you can
                    tell them how big of a package you want your cash to be packed in but
                    you can. the cash comes vacuum sealed and double bagged. Vacuum sealed
                    cash gets very stiff and hard, once opened it’s amazing how much space
                    it takes. I can cover my Queen sized modified Ikea bed really well with
                    only 1 – $10,000 package of $20’s. It is comfortable to spend and can be
                    deposited into banks. However, I have not told people where I bought
                    the cash and asked for a review of what they think of it.Now to
                    some issues I have seen right out of the bag. The corners of some of the
                    bills were bent, and some were very deeply creased. You can tell this
                    by running your hand over the bill or inspecting it closely. All the
                    water marks and security features are present but some are worn or in
                    poor condition. Overall this is a pretty decent product.Reply

                    where you get what you order. I think he believes he is providing a
                    service that others need. However, the $1300 here $5000 there orders are
                    trivial in the scope of things.I know he could be making more money if he just worked with his larger

                    can tell you my experience in Europe has been mostly positive. Euro was
                    new generation bills. My packages came out of Germany. I am not sure if
                    that is true or it is a mask to hide their real place. I am currently
                    waiting on my 5th order €10.000. The product is professionally packaged

                    random person you make a good point. I also have gotten screwed by a
                    couple of sellers on locabitcoins. They take a steep profit for
                    themselves and I paid for it. I started moving my coin though Jeff as
                    an alternative and it was a good choice. Though every time I get a
                    package from him I still check the money for counterfeit. So far no
                    found to date.Reply

                Hi,
                    everyone, apparently bitcoin is regulated in New York. And it costs $5k
                    to get a license. (Don’t believe me, google it) Does anyone have
                    experience or know any more info on how to get around this. I looked up
                    >BitLicense< and found that things I do not like about trading
                    bitcoin without regulation. (in NY state). I also found this warning on a
                    local bitcoin sellers page: >WARNING: Due to New York’s BitLicense,
                    we will NOT do business with any person that resides, is located, has a
                    place of business, or is conducting business in New York.<Reply

                Many
                    people do not realize the actions their governments take. The USA does
                    some pretty shifty things in order to bend the reality in their favor.
                    So do other 14 Eyes Nations. I wish I could tell all the things I know,
                    but that would be certain jail time or worse for me. I will give you a
                    very basic case and point with information that is in the clear. Air
                    Force One cost about $3,000 per minute to operate in the air. Its about
                    $1800 per min while on the ground. Think about that for a moment….. A
                    flight from Washington DC to Palm Beach Florida is roughly 2 hours in
                    the air. Thats $360,000 for a one way flight! If you look at it round
                    trip plus ground cost thats over $1 million. Not to mention that some of
                    the planes we have designed costs Billions of dollars and some are
                    never produced!! Using discarded (or soon to be discarded) treasury
                    currency is nothing. When people say it ruins the economy… The amount of
                    cash that is stolen is a drop in the bucket compared to what the
                    government is spending things on. Most of those things never see the
                    light of day! Listen , I love my country and gave many years of service
                    to her, but money is going in the wrong direction and the 1% is keeping
                    it while the other 99% kill each other for what is left. That is not the
                    American Dream!Reply

                    shit. Bitcoin and Gold will be the best resource.I could give 2

                I
                    have ordered several packages from cashgod for a total of €45.000.
                    The stealth techniques used are the best I have seen from any vendor. I
                    Recommend to anyone shipping to Germany or France.Reply

                    I am ordering the Gold package in Euro. I pay enough taxes in the EU
                    and my salary after the taxes is low. Now I get bonus without taxes.Reply

                Got
                    the cash for me and my son…mostly me. It is as described. Since I am
                    new to having money, I was looking for a 1 stop shop to get in and gain
                    rich. instructions were easy. cash packaged well. Everything worked.
                    $5,000 in $100’s is incredibly light. Deposited in the bank just fine.
                    cash checks out well, spends and gave a little boy cash to buy some food
                    I bought an RC airplane. We crashed a few time into grass – so no
                    damage done. Get some extra batteries if you buy one, which are
                    relatively inexpensive, and enjoy. Its just fun. Stack purchase from
                    cashgod +1 !!Reply

                    was one of those that got scammed by one of the clones. They had a

                    be advertising or have a portal through facebook. Lesson learned.However
                    Jeff was a true gent and added the cash I lost when I ordered the
                    Professional. There are not many guys out there who would do that for
                    their customers, even when it was the customers fault for being stupid.
                    Thanks Jeff. I will recommend you to everyone I know.BTW….for those
                    of you out there dont believe reviews on reddit or anywhere else. They

                K,
                    so right off the bat I will say >WOW<. I was not expecting this
                    to go as well as it has, kind of seems too good to be true. Upon
                    delivery I was amazed at how light the package was. Before opening the
                    package, I actually held it with one hand while I jerked off with the
                    other. I was fearing it to be empty because of it’s light weight, but
                    once opened, I was pleasantly surprised. The cash is great, it passed
                    all tests, deposited in a bank without issues. Previously I’ve had
                    issues with other TOR vendors, so this was a great relief. I just bought
                    a TV with the cash and I connected it to a very handy Winegard FL-55YR

                    2.5 yrs and 6 mos. I purchased the Elite with my first and spent it all
                    within 1 months. I purchased the Pro with my second and have used it
                    all within 5 weeks now and still going strong. I have a LOT to say about
                    this cash, but the bottom line is cashgod is an excellent
                    upstanding company.. save yourself time, money, and frustration and
                    purchase a standard. Even if you dont ideas on how to spend it, order
                    it. You’ll figure out ways to spend the money trust me.Reply

                    does not matter. Women want a man with money. I know that sounds shallow
                    but they want to know you can provide for them. Love fades really fast

                    get yourself a woman. JenReply

                We
                    have been using cashgod since December 2017. Prior to that time, my
                    husband had been working two jobs for several weeks. He is currently
                    uneducated and struggles getting a decent job. We immediately purcahsed
                    the basic and pro as well as the overnight shipping. We wanted both
                    currencies to do a fair comparison. Others might enjoy the GBP because
                    they live in England and it’s convenient, but we aren’t interested. It’s
                    worth noting that our local bank accepted the USD and Euro. We had to
                    fill out some currency exchange paperwork at our bank but it wasnt that
                    hard. My idiot husband was able to figure it out so any of you can also
                    i’m sure. We use the cash to pay our mortgage a lot, and my husband has
                    added things to the shopping list when he remembers, he can never
                    remember what he wants when I go. Should I mention he adds things like
                    grey goose vodka when I’m not looking? And that’s OK because we have the
                    money to buy it. We transport ourselfs in a new Ford Mustang since it
                    is easier to pay the car note each month. I was a bit worried at first
                    about Jeff’s possible ties with criminal groups, but my feelings
                    eventually fipped the opposite way! I love making the government suffer.
                    They have made us suffer for so long after all. My granddaughter was
                    happy to see her bills paid. My daughter is a breeze to impress with new
                    toys. I purchased the best meditation apps and iTunes music. I won’t
                    say it revolutionized our lives, but it has made our lives much more
                    normal.Reply

                    agree , nothing we can do about moments in life when there isnt enough
                    money. I too was scared to buy something >large<. Then I realized
                    >large< is a state of mind. For me $5,000 seems like a REALLY
                    LARGE amount of money. Then I realized if I was a millionaire $5,000
                    would be nothing. So I bought the $25,000 package. Yes it was a
                    sacrifice but in the end I am glad I did. Its time to start thinking
                    like a millionaire.Reply

                Having
                    a shortage of cash is inevitable in our life and there is nothing we
                    can do about it. And I know, there are rich fuckers all over who can
                    wave money around and get the hottest pussy in town. But that’s not our
                    case. I am broke flat broke, girl friend is a 7/10 and she gets slightly
                    less good looking when she takes her clothes off and I see the saggy
                    boobs. But I still like her. My girlfriend hates grocery shopping, she
                    can never buy enough food, not enough money. Earlier i gave my
                    girlfriend flowers, but it’s so easy for a woman to see how cheap they
                    are, drop the thing down, and resent you. The price of a good woman is
                    money. At first, I considered buying a $5,000 package, but there are so
                    many benefits to having more cash on hand than $5k. In my opinion it’s
                    definitely worth to pay for the $10k pack or greater. The shipping time
                    is great, sometimes i’m unhappy with overnight shipping taking 2 days
                    showhow. but beggers cant be choosers. During the first day I felt
                    amazing. The second day it felt less and more normal.Reply

                Friends,
                    a quick update concerning our friends at Christians in Action. They are
                    actively working with Foreign entities to bring down some of the
                    biggest and best sites on the dark web. We have seen this with Alpha Bay
                    and of course Silk Road back in the day. It is known that Cousins in
                    Christians in Action are sending thousands of fake reviews and fake
                    profiles, including Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat. Not to mention
                    the fake directories, portals, and other items of psych ops. I noticed a
                    few posts here discussing The Hidden Wiki (THW) and reviews on other
                    sites. If you have not read my prior posts do so. Especially if you are
                    new to the darknet and tor. Cousins are notorious for establishing fake
                    credentials in order to steer illegal business in the direction they
                    want. For example, if you see reviews or links to >The Hidden
                    Wiki< on sites like youtube, facebook, etc relating to illegal
                    products on the darknet then be cautious. Think for just a minute if
                    someone posted on youtube about the darknet it violates youtubes terms
                    of service… ie they take it down. But if it is left up on the site you
                    have to ask yourself why? Common practice in the Christians in Action
                    organization is to misdirect and collect information. That is it. Then
                    with the information they posses they pass it along to the relevent
                    agency who then makes arrests or whatever is next in their plan. If you
                    see negative reviews on clearnet sites for illegal products, especially
                    if they are on sites owned by Google, Facebook..etc, they are most
                    likely there to either scare customers from a specific site or drive
                    them to it. You will see several >Hidden Wiki< links that all
                    claim to be the official and original. But those who know the darknet
                    know their is only one that has been around and continues to be around.
                    The others drive you to sites that are suspect or with negative reviews
                    attempting to stop people from using certain sites. If you blindly
                    accept what you read on the clearnet or from what you find on a Google
                    search then you are setting yourself up for trouble. Be smart.Reply

                    – Recently some packages have been delayed 1-2 days for various
                    reasons. We have been reading your complaining emails whining about how
                    your cash took a little longer to receive and how you want discounts on
                    future orders. So we got together as a team and decided our official

                    I was afraid, I was petrified Kept thinking I could never live without
                    cash by my side And I spent so many nights thinking how I was so poor
                    And I grew strong and I learned how to get along …… Robin BirdReply

                We
                    tried that once. The problem is people would make multiple profiles and
                    keep asking for Cash promising to send BTC once it’s received. Then
                    they would get the cash, not send us any BTC and make a new profile and
                    ask for the same thing. Over and over. Fuck thatJeffReply

                A
                    warning to those of you who bank with chase. I went to deposit the cash
                    I received from my order. BTW I ordered the Elite 25k…. I took $12,400
                    to the bank to deposit and pay off my Chase Visa. The clerk took the
                    money and tested it… then put it in the a counting machine…. Another
                    clerk comes over and says I cant deposit the money at the counter
                    because they do not take more than 10k in cash for credit card payments.
                    Its some new policy. Am I fucked or is this a real policy where they
                    dont take cash? I dont have a chase checking or savings only the visa.Reply

                    written in their policy. Check out their website. I would never walk
                    into a bank and hand over that amount of money. Remember the Feds track
                    all deposits over 10k in the USA. You are making yourself a target. Do
                    small deposits over a couple of weeks. I know you want to pay off your
                    credit card but be smart about it.Reply

                First,
                    thank you for the cash. It will help us a great deal. I do have 1 favor
                    to ask…. Do not ship money inside sex toys. I opened my mail with my 3
                    yo at the kitchen table. I didnt think it was nice for her to see a 11
                    inch black dildo. I definitely didnt want her seeing me having to pull
                    5000 in cash out the bottom of it. Thats all. Otherwise the process was
                    smooth.Reply

                As
                    you requested I am posting my findings about our friends with
                    Christians in Action. Looks like AB was compromised using Psych Ops Part
                    of the psych ops used was with the reviews. It looks like they put up
                    thousands of positive reviews and even some of the vendors were CIA
                    cousins. The mission was to increase sales in the last 30-60 days of AB
                    operation to collect as much intel including vendor and customer
                    information. They were also able to track bitcoin transfers from
                    compromised vendors. Again it goes to show dont trust >reviews<
                    either good or bad. The cousins are good at either driving people to a
                    site or pushing them away depending on whether or not they want you
                    doing business there.Reply

                JOEWe
                    know what the CIA/NSA is doing. Lots of Noobs use the darknet and they
                    dont understand how to use it. No one in their right mind would post
                    their experience on the clearnet about their purchase of stolen money.
                    That would be sure way of getting put in jail.Expanding on what JOE
                    said… If you are new to the darknet NEVER EVER use GMAIL, Outlook etc..
                    Definitely dont post on the clearnet on how you purchased stolen
                    pre-shred cash. Please understand, your gmail, outlook, etc is scanned
                    all the time. Your comments, videos etc are traced back to you by IP and
                    username as well as a digital fingerprint that you can not control. I
                    know of a couple of noobs who were arrested for doing stupid shit like
                    that. Plus Google (Gmail Youtube) remove the comments and videos. Its
                    against their policy to keep it posted.The only comments and videos that
                    are kept on the clearnet are from Law Enforcement including (NSA/CIA).
                    They serve two purposes, first, to scare people from using the darknet
                    or specific sites on the darknet. Second, to encourage criminals and
                    people who need to launder money to sites they are tracking.If you ever
                    see a darknet site on the clearnet with good reviews, videos, etc.. stay
                    away. Its being monitored. Likewise the reverse usually is LE trying to
                    keep people from buying at that site by scaring them away. They hope to
                    take away enough business that the site will just close down.I have
                    been buying from Jeff for almost a year now. There is no way he would
                    shut down unless he was out of money to sell.Food for Thought…..Reply

                The
                    government is always been trying to bring and his operation down. They
                    have a hell of time trying to find him. This game they play trying to
                    scare people off is old news.I have said it before and I will say it
                    again. I think Jeff should shut this down so that the public doesnt
                    have access anymore. There are many of us veterans who buy large orders
                    every 2 weeks. I think he should just sell to us and keep this thing
                    private.Reply

                    like our friends at Christians in Action are engaging in some more
                    psyops. In addition to fake reviews they are posting videos as well.
                    These guys are trying to stop you the only way they can. They do not
                    want you distributing this money. I have also learned at locals are very
                    upset at the most recent shipment of pre-shred you acquired. They do
                    not want you selling it.Reply

            ConflictedJuly 9, 2018 at 1:54 pm
                I
                    bought this because it gave me hope. I expected this to be fake and
                    most likely loose my money. After I paid I never heard from anyone. 4
                    days later a package from Fedex arrived. Inside was $4,980… I paid for
                    $5,000, but that is not the point. Now I am conflicted at to whether I
                    should spend this money. I am not sure how the got it. I know they say
                    how but I dont know if that is true or not. So now I dont know if I
                    should spend it or not. I feel like I have personally stole from the
                    government. IDK what to do. Can others tell me its ok so I can feel
                    better? I look at all this cash and I dont know what to do.Reply

                If
                    you’re that scared just go out and buy visa gift cards or youtube how
                    to put cash on paypal, that way you can spend your money without
                    stressing so much. but i mean you knew what you were doing when you
                    bought that package so you shouldn’t be that scared lolReply

                    least you can do is take what is rightfully yours and pay it foward,

                    am super confused…. I ordered my package with overnight on Friday
                    around 7pm. Tracking shows it arrives today (10th) but Jeff wont email
                    me back when I ask him to double check the tracking #. I gave the wrong
                    address in my first email and then corrected it in the second email. I
                    want to be sure it was sent to the correct address. Wasn’t here
                    Saturday, and not on Sunday. So now i’m playing the waiting game to see
                    if there were any problems or if it arrives. some communication would be
                    nice. Communication was great before payment… But after he sent the
                    tracking info – nothing.Reply

                Well
                    so far i ordered overnight shipment a week ago and and I got my
                    tracking number… Jeff was good at keeping in contact with me through
                    the entire transaction. Once i made a payment I got my tracking number
                    in about 5 hours. I was scared, as this was my first transaction but I
                    kept faith. I got my package this morning and it was exactly what I
                    ordered. Thank you!Reply

                    Will it fit in a normal box or will it need to be shipped in two
                    seperate shipments?Reply

                    want to put attention on yourself. The law is 10k in any 24 hour period,

                We
                    are getting lots of questions emailed to us. We dont mind questions but
                    most of them are related to answers we already have posted on our
                    website. The best advice I can give is to read the FAQ’s first before
                    asking a question. Most likely your answer is there.We get tons of
                    emails everyday. We dont have time to answer the same questions over and
                    over again. Please post your questions on the forum. If you have a
                    question then most likely others have the same question. Posting it on
                    the forum allows everyone to get answers fast. Plus it will help us with
                    the emails to focus on getting packages out in a timely manner.Keep up

                    incomplete shipment address fucks things up and slows down the process.

                    Dumb ass you need a valid address in order to get the shipment. I
                    emailed you and it took you 11 hours to respond. You missed the shipment
                    deadline to get it to overnight.The instructions on the site are very
                    clear. You must have a legit address to ship to otherwise we cant ship
                    it.Go buy credit cards, I dont want your business. You cant follow

                    dont worry about the 96 series bills. They get pulled all the time.
                    Several of my shipments have 96 series bills. I have never had a problem
                    depositing them. In the USA all bills that were legally printed are
                    legal currency today no matter when the date. 96 series bills spent

                    not sure what you are. I did get my box of cash and it passed the
                    counterfeit tests I used. However, it was supposed to be overnight and
                    it took 3 days. Not sure why. I emailed about the issue and I never got a
                    response. I am considering another order but I hope the service is a
                    little bit better. The product is great.Reply

                    of this. The longer you sit on the sidelines the more money you miss out

                I
                    have ordered here twice. In both instances I received the cash that was
                    ordered. As a prior member of the Christians In Action and with Cousins
                    still in the group it is standard procedure to plant a decoy to disrupt
                    illegal trade. Christians in Action has deployed several thousand decoy
                    sites and reviews with the intent of poisoning the revenue stream of
                    its targets.If you are on the clearnet conducting research about dark
                    web sites and activities then most likely ( over 90% confidence) the
                    information you are reading has been planted by Christians in Action
                    and/or one or more of its non affiliated Cousins. Jeff’s operation does
                    a excellent job Dry Cleaning their operation. I am sure its driving the
                    US government crazy.I post this as an admirer of this site and its
                    operator or operators >Jeff<. I believe the Robin Hood principle
                    is noble and, based on Christians in Action activities, he is very
                    successful at the acquisition and disposition of very large amounts of
                    US currency.I write this for the benefit of all visitors of the dark
                    web. Information warfare is alive and well on the clearnet. This
                    includes Youtube videos and forums. Just because you see a housewife on a
                    youtube video giving you her review from the kitchen does not mean its
                    really a house wife in her kitchen giving you her review. This applies
                    to >children< who also appear in videos or only via audio.
                    Recruitment for more Cousins who are legal age (18+) but look and sound
                    younger are of high priority due to their ability to infiltrate and or
                    poison a pool. They are highly effective when used in Psyops.Be smart.
                    If this is your first visit to the darknet know that you are now in a
                    world no longer control by any one entity. Operations such as this one
                    are difficult to stop so misinformation and other techniques are the
                    most effective. Unfortunately it is highly convincing and stops
                    individuals from benefiting and/or profiting from the Robin Hood effect.Reply

                Hey
                    thanks for bringing this up. This website is a clone/dishonest website
                    run by an Indian scam team.As more evidence that we’re the real site:1.
                    Updating forum – their forum’s last comment was in October 2017.2.

                So
                    I am a first time customer and bought the 10k deal. Most of the cash I
                    got was in 20’s. I am trying to convert my cash into my local currency.
                    The guy at the exchange said he doesn’t buy 20’s only 100’s. I guess I
                    will order 100’s with my next order.Jeff have you heard of anything
                    like this before?Reply

                Look,
                    everything has its pros and cons. I am an elite client with Jeff.
                    Which basically means I have bought a shit ton of cash. The pros of this
                    site. It delivers real cash. Jeff uses good stealth for the shipping.
                    The cons-you can only order once every 2 weeks. Some bullshit about
                    making sure there is enough cash for everyone. If it were up to me I
                    would just by it all and fuck the rest of you. But no, I have to buy
                    every two weeks like everyone else.If you are still on the fence. Dont
                    do it!! You are not ready for this lifestyle. Plus it means more cash

                    All,I was *highly* skeptical. In fact I thought buycash was selling
                    high quality counterfeit and saying it was real cash. I placed my order
                    on Tuesday morning with 2-3 day shipping, tracking received Tuesday
                    night, package received today. This is not counterfeit, it’s 100%
                    genuine and I took it to the bank. I see good reviews and I am going to
                    add my voice to theirs. I will be definitely getting 50,000k next time

                    have written the book >Sin No More: From Abortion to Stem Cells,
                    Understanding Crime, Law, and Morality in America< and I am a

                    admit studying the TOR Network is a passion of mine, I have particularly
                    enjoyed watching your organization. I have heard about you inside my
                    circles since you created your group almost a year ago. Taking into
                    account who your stealing from, The FED, I have expected you to fail
                    numerous times. I still don’t understand how you manage to steal this
                    cash from them.I firmly believe you will be crushed by the US Legal
                    System, it is the best in the world. We catch all of the criminals and
                    remove them from society. Criminals do not belong in society, they
                    belong behind bars thinking about their mistakes. I think I will see
                    your face in the news someday, however I have respect for your

                    think our government is corrupt and we send too many people to prison
                    for too long. I think the criminal justice system is broken. I may end
                    up going to jail but you probably deserve to be there more than

                    Stack a sum of cash moneyThe stack only goes up or down and
                    it’s your main job to make it go up.The stack is your best friend.The
                    stack doesn’t lie, doesn’t cheat and doesn’t betray. The stack doesn’t
                    judge you, doesn’t harm you and doesn’t plot against you.The stack is
                    always there for you, in good times and it bad times.It makes bad times
                    better and it makes good time amazing.The stack might make some of your
                    fake friends jealous and it’s best enjoyed with your real niggas, the
                    ones that were there for you when you didn’t have much stack.When lost,
                    just look at the stack for mentoring: will the stack go up or down
                    following your action? Once you know the answer, you know what to do.Reply

                    US is not so innocent. Look, the fact is the odds are stacked against
                    us. Wall Street and a few elite have control of the money system and we
                    are so stupid to believe in it. Listen people get your head out of your
                    ass and stop the rat race you are in. How hard do you work everyday just
                    to get a few slips of paper that a government says is worth something.
                    Actually, now you dont even get paper. Its just numbers in a computer

                    understand doing your do diligence. I did as well. I actually waited a
                    month before placing my first order. Now I wish I had done it sooner.Reply

                This
                    was my first transaction on the darknet. I was very nervous. I placed
                    my order for a $1300 Basic on Friday the 10th of March. I sent the
                    bitcoin to Jeff to a wallet address he provided. After 3 or so hours I
                    got a shipping confirmation and tracking number stating my package would
                    arrived 15th of March. BTW I used the free shipping option. The package
                    arrived this morning via USPS. The envelope was a generic USPS envelope
                    and was sealed. Inside the envelope was a shrink wrapped DVD and a paid
                    invoice for $11.95 for the DVD. At this point I thought I received the
                    wrong piece of mail. I opened the DVD and inside was a sealed black bag.
                    I used some scissors and cut the top of the bag open. Inside was $1300
                    in various bills. Most of the bills were in fairly good condition. 8
                    $100 bills and 50 $20 bills.I know people are probably looking at this
                    site and wondering whether or not to order. I was one of those people.
                    Overall I am please with the transaction and would do another order with
                    them.Reply

                    know that sounds crazy. I don’t want to deposit it in the bank because
                    we have done that already and I don’t want to raise suspicion. I am

                    Ask my SelfI get my shipments sent to one of those businesses that take
                    mail for small home based businesses. I use one of the business name
                    and tell the girl at the front desk I am with the company. There is so
                    much traffic there they never catch on. When I sign I scribble gibberish
                    so no one can tell what name is written on their. Even if they did I

                    E.J.First off, Technically, ACE and his crew are saving money that is
                    about to be destroyed so that it can go back into the economy, get
                    taxed, and that tax money goes to pay your social security. So
                    technically ACE and the CiK crew are doing the economy a favor by
                    keeping thisperfectly good money in ciruclation.Second of all, If the
                    ‘White Knights’ at the govornment could crack down on on ACE and crew,
                    he would be long gone and the site would be history.Third, thanks for
                    proving every sterotype we melienals have about old people. That you are
                    old, cranky, profane, and you blame my gereration for all of your
                    problems.Thanks for proving me right 🙂BTW, my generation has made more

                    government says it is.Guys like buycash are fucking around with
                    their system. I am sure they are going after them with everything they
                    got with fake reviews and DOS attacks etc. Of course they cant find them
                    via tor so they do the next best thing and try to scare people into not
                    buying the pre shred cash.Look people the government has fucked us over
                    and big banks and greedy politicians have taken over by tweaking the
                    system in their favor. The team at buycash has evened the score and
                    let us have our money back. The money belongs to the people. Plus, you
                    could make much better use of the money than your government.Just my two
                    cents for what its worth.Reply

                    I saw the same reviews. I still jumped in and ordered a couple days
                    ago. Got my package this afternoon. It was pretty fast. So I’m not sure
                    what the negative reviews are from. I know Jeff has said the government
                    posts negative reviews in hopes of stopping people from buying the
                    stolen cash. It makes sense to me. The government does some fucked up
                    shit.Reply

                    it was a porn revenge website. Guys would post pictures of their
                    X-girlfriends they wanted revenge on to the website. What was fucked up
                    is they included the girl’s real name and real address with the naked
                    photos. A few girls committed suicide because they were listed on it.

                    found the one I liked the best. Great experience.All together it cost
                    me $13,500. So all the Whisky was emptied into 750 ML bottles. I hoped
                    to get the whisky in the barrel to take home, not so. I also got a
                    framed certificate signed by the Master Distiller, a plaque, Crystal

                    Diablo666, as you know I have been a long time customer. I have posted
                    some reviews about my experience with buycash . Now I am seeing
                    several of these posts around the dark net and clear net have been
                    changed to negative reviews.I did some investigative work, as you know
                    some of my background, and found that in every case they all trace back
                    to either US Secret Service and Department of Homeland Security. So
                    basically the US government is changing and posting fake negative
                    reviews about buycash .These guys are serious about taking you down.

                    have my shipment but about $1,200 worth of 100s have cocaine on them.
                    You can tell someone was doing lines with the bills. It is kind of
                    nasty. Could you please clean the cash before you send it?Reply

                This
                    was my first purchase with buycash . I bought the Elite $25,000
                    package. Since it was my first transaction I used escrow.Process went
                    smoothly from the time of order and deposit with escrow company. It took
                    4 days to receive the cash. Cash was in 20s, 50s, and 100s . Packaging
                    was secure and cash well hidden.I will be ordering again.Thank you.Reply

                    I was questioning if this was real also. I did my first order in mid

                    is still spendable. Most of the time cash comes in DVD’s with sealed
                    bags inside. Its good stealth.Just my 2 cents. Enjoy.Reply

                    took a girl out from work last night for valentines day. I took her to a
                    very expensive restaurant, our bill for the 2 of us was $700. We went
                    out to some clubs afterwards I paid for a VIP table service and made
                    sure we was treated like first class. She asked me how I have all this
                    money.I told her I have a good investment strategy. Oh. and yes I fucked
                    her brains out last night. Not bad, since earlier at dinner she said
                    she never gives it up on the first date. Money really does turn a girl

                Yes
                    guys everybody knows Sigaint is down. It looks like we will just have
                    to wait for Sigaint to come back up to place more orders. Unless Jeff
                    goes about creating a Torbox email for a little while until Sigaint
                    comes back up which is what I did. Just be patient everybody, I’m sure
                    it will come back up soon.Reply

                    up to the guy, he’s like the criminal father I never had. So I
                    submitted recordings of my classical piano music to him and he told me
                    to >fuck that, music is for retards and blind Negros< I thought
                    Jeff was a class act, but I guess he’s just the guy to ask for Cash.

                    I would pass this along to everyone. I have been ordering from cashgod for a few months and believe it or not I was stumped as tohow to
                    spend the cash. So I had an idea and it is working very well. Youmay
                    want to try it.I started lending the money I received from cashgod .
                    I started withsome people at the Dog Track and Casino. Then spread the
                    word aroundsome local bars. I was nervous, but I had customers on the
                    first day.People need cash. We have a great source of it through
                    cashgod.I am getting a vig of 5 points per day. I even hired a guy to
                    help me>collect< I am up to 2,000 per week and growing in
                    addition tomy cash I get from cashgod every 2 weeks or so.Does anyone
                    else have ideas on how to use pre shred cash to make more money???Reply

                    2nd order went much smoother than my first. I was sure the FBI was
                    going to deliver the cash to me for the first order. That did not happen

                Risking
                    $325 to figure out if you’re legit—scary shit. But I guess that’s like
                    double or nothing roulette bets in Vegas, and I’d spend at least that on
                    a hotel there, so whatever. Hope you guys are legit, because I’m hoping
                    to ride $325 into 7 figures.Reply

            Hooker problemsDecember 15, 2017 at 3:33 pm
                Hello
                    everyone I wanted to share a lesson.I got a hooker for a few hours like
                    I always do.I used protection as always.Instead of using this
                    >Pre-shred< i tried to pay the hooker with counterfeit. Guess
                    what?The hooker could feel the difference between real and fake cash.
                    She hit me in the crotch twice, took my wallet and left.Jokes on her I
                    have Syphilis, But my lesson is always to pay with real cash. You can
                    ALWAYS feel fake cash.Reply

                    of a gift this cash is. My parents always gave me alot of money growing

                    After we receive the Basic package can we order the Elite from a
                    different address which is 2 miles away from the first address?Reply

            Acid BurnDecember 12, 2017 at 3:23 pm
                I
                    ordered, got the cash and posted back when this operation started back a
                    few months ago. Look for me about 1,000 posts ago >Acid Burn<.
                    I’ve ordered ever since then. Back in the old days you could order as
                    many packages as you wanted each week. One week I got three (3) – $5,000
                    packages. In the early days I tried to do as many orders as I could
                    because I thought they were doing a pyramid scheme. Pyramid schemes
                    quickly become non-profitable for the organization running it because
                    they soon pay out more money then they receive. I am now 100% sure this
                    is not a pyramid scheme, the numbers just dont add up. I’ve done two
                    packages of $200,000 for the past two weeks. I don’t recommend new
                    buyers start at the highest point but I do think you all should try to
                    work your way up there, financial freedom feels good. If it was a
                    pyramid scheme he would have to process at least 600 Basic orders for
                    each one of my $200k orders. The numbers just dont add up. I sincerely
                    believe they are stealing from the government.Jeff – Criminals always
                    get caught. I’ve done time myself. But I will stick with you and keep
                    buying until it happens. And I hope and pray you do not get caught. Be

                    I paid $40 for FEDEX overnight and they USPS 2-3 day shipped the
                    fucking package. I let Jeff know he was a shit head and made a mistake.
                    He said they would overnight the next one for free.11/14/16 – >Pro –

                    MONEY for me. I let Jeff know he was a mother fucker. Clearly he was
                    trying to spitefully screw me over. He replied >Hey man be cool, you
                    still made $8250 profit right?< You FUCKER, I dont care about the

                    (12/6/16) and the quantity was good (all $100k) However I was VERY clear
                    that I wanted ALL $100’s. And fucking guess what? He sent $80,000 in
                    $100’s and $20,000 in $50’s. FUCKING $50 BILLS!!!!! I DID NOT WANT $50’S

                The
                    politicians are put there to give you the idea you have freedom of
                    choice. You don’t. You have no choice. You have owners. They own you.
                    They own everything. They own all the important land, they own and
                    control the corporations that’ve long since bought and paid for, the
                    senate, the congress, the state houses, the city halls, they got the
                    judges in their back pocket, and they own all the big media companies so
                    they control just about all of the news and the information you get to
                    hear. They got you by the balls. They spend billions of dollars every
                    year lobbying to get what they want. Well, we know what they want. They
                    want more for themselves and less for everybody else. But I’ll tell you
                    what they don’t want. They don’t want you ruining the economy by buying
                    stolen cash from >Cash is King<. This is real but buy at your own

                DivisionDecember 7, 2017 at 1:45 am
                My
                    opposition and my plea for users to steer clear is rooted only in the
                    fact the website’s operators are reptilian and anti-human. They come
                    many light-years away from Earth and settle on our planet to cause
                    financial chaos and to destroy the human race.After careful studying of
                    our prior investigations, I can now say with great confidence that the
                    operators behind this website >Cash is King< were accessory to the
                    orchestraters of the 2008 depression. They knew about it beforehand and
                    assisted in the financial ruin. These website operators are key players
                    in the reptilian agenda, and while I wish to capture them, these
                    reptilian entities continue to elude us since the beginning of mankind
                    and my efforts would be futile. They possess ability to >teleport<
                    and various more other-worldly mechanisms and tools to avoid
                    detection.So while the Agency is aware that if we do have a lead on
                    >Cash is King,< they will employ highly-advanced reptilian
                    technology and avoid detection.I want to stress to the website users,
                    the money is real. Bank tellers and ATMs will accept it as genuine cash.
                    But you are buying it from reptilians and anti-human entities who seek
                    to destroy the world. Is free money worth selling your soul to the
                    devil?Think about that for a minute.My name is Special Agent Sean and
                    this is my advice.Reply

            Federal Bureau of Investigation-- Financial DivisionDecember 5, 2017 at 5:51 am
                Hi,I
                    am Special Agent Sean from the Federal Bureau of Investigation. You can
                    reach me at Sean.Keith@2.fbi.gov. I have come here to recommend all
                    users to cease-and-desist purchases from this website. We have very
                    strong evidence indicating that the website’s owners have nefarious
                    motivations for mankind and humanity. While I have indicated above these
                    amounts of money were marked as ‘discarded.’ They were not. These are
                    actually printed money with highly-advanced technology. While the
                    website’s operators paint the picture that this cash were merely
                    ‘intercepted’ on-route to being shredded, that is simply not true.I can
                    reveal, after reviewing our sensitive but unclassified documents that
                    these currencies are of what is commonly-known as >reptilian<
                    origin. We actively seek to refuse to alert the public of
                    >reptilian< presence on Earth as it would cause exactly what our
                    reptilian hosts desire for, total chaos. The >reptilians< were
                    responsible for the tsunamis or WTC attacks. I want to stress that the
                    capabilities these reptilians do possess in relation to our natural
                    environment is the ability to create earthquakes. Having lived
                    underground the majority of their life-spans, they have a greater
                    understanding of the underworld than we ourselves, this is where they
                    gain their earthquake-knowledge. They can be attributed to the recent
                    earthquakes that shook the world. You might be asking yourself, why are
                    there so many earthquakes all of a sudden? What do you think?These
                    reptilians use advanced technology to print these currencies. This is
                    why you will never get a ‘worn’ or ‘torn’ bill, despite these bills
                    being marked as being too worn for circulation. The very method behind
                    this operation is intercepting money that is >too worn< for
                    circulation, yet, when you order money from these nefarious entities,
                    you will never get worn money. Why is this so? They use highly-advanced
                    technology to print replica currency that can, at times, even make real
                    genuine currency look counterfeit. That is how high-quality this
                    machinery are. Now this is an aberration, you will never get their
                    perfectly-looking bills as it will arouse suspicion as to how they
                    acquired money that looks better the money approved to circulate, while
                    they advertise discarded money that cannot be circulated anymore. So
                    what they do is create something in between, but you will never get
                    money that is too worn accidentally. What they would do is throw some
                    intentionally but this is all a deception. The >too worn< money
                    (i.e. ripped/defaced) would be added to your pile intentionally to make
                    it appear as if their source of money is too worn.Here is a little test
                    we can all do right now. For everyone who bought currency from this
                    website, look at your currency right now. Is the face on the bill the
                    face of a human or reptile?I am not here as an FBI Agent trying to stop
                    illegal activity and put a stop to the blackmarket by issuing
                    anti-blackmarket propaganda regarding of these reptilian hosts. This is
                    not the 1960s, government-propaganda has been outlawed many years ago
                    back during the Great War efforts.We cannot arrest the operators of this
                    website as they possess reptilian origin and will continue to elude us
                    since the beginning of mankind. The websites operators are attempting to
                    purposely disrupt the world financial system to cause total chaos. I
                    want to emphasize they are not >intercepting< pre-shred money.I
                    want to warn the users here that these website operators are
                    reptilian-hosts. They do not need your money or profit. They do not
                    care. They have no need for money. They only seek to cause global chaos.
                    They also not care about your moral issues as they consistently remind
                    us as reptilians are devoid of morality and empathy that humans are
                    normally equipped with. I use the term >normally< as even
                    pure-human leaders have indicated behavior reminiscent of
                    reptilian-personality, but they were likely influenced by
                    greater-superiors of reptilian origin. They are not trying to make money
                    from this website (they can make as much money as they want), they only
                    seek to destabilize and destroy the world’s financial systems. By
                    ushering global chaos and crisis, the reptilians will realize their
                    ultimate goal, annihilation of the human race.– Special Agent Sean

                So
                    2 of my $20’s has white powder on them. I’m 90% sure its cocaine.
                    Please can you not send bills with white powder on them in the future?
                    My wife is freaking out about the powder getting into the air and
                    getting our kids high on cocaine.If it does end up getting my kids high
                    on cocaine I’m going to be extremely upset. I may drug test them later
                    just to be sure.Reply

                    emails. I ordered the $10,000 in $100’s, so that’s 100x$100 bills. They
                    are mostly in really good condition actually. Very pleased overall. I
                    tested the bills in every way possible to make sure they arent
                    counterfeit, they are 100% valid/real bills.Reply

                    On The Way I’m Nervous- To answer your question yes the bills are real
                    and yes you can spend them at stores. The bills are pre- shredded bills
                    which means they are old and unfit to be in circulation anylonger. Hope
                    that answers your questions.If you have anymore questions ask Jeff he
                    is happy to help.Reply

                    customs about 19/20 times. Shipping from Germany is helping us alot

                    am HIGHLY skeptical!!! I got the $1,300 cash package but I straight up
                    think its drug money because its in GOOD shape. I thought this was cash
                    selected for disposal? The cash works in ATM’s but I think there is
                    something very fishy going on. personally I think these guys may be the

                few
                    questions!1. EUROs are also used (sheduled to shredder as well?) or
                    they are USD changed into new EUROs?2. No one from commenting people
                    posted some photos before, can u do it please?3. If someone don’t live
                    in the US and have different cash than USD and EURO can he just easily
                    go into nearest exchange store and exchange the cash? Even bigger
                    amounts? I have to hide my face from cameras?4. Let’s say I live in a
                    village and the postman probably would call to me and ask where the fuck
                    my house is cause he can’t find it, can I just give my phone number
                    with the order address? (just bought prepaid)5. Moar pictures please!I

                    – Hello kind sir your have to consider their operation. They have a
                    steady supply of banknotes that they procured for very low cost. Have
                    you attempted to spend €1 million Euro before? how about 1+ mil every
                    week or so? It is not easy now days with everyone using plastic cards.
                    You cannot buy cars or houses with Cash any more. If they get discovered
                    then they lose this flow of Euro and go to jail. I think they would
                    rather be very safe than risk themselves and go to jail. I am sure they
                    have stashes of Euro and USD for each member of their team also.With all
                    due respect to you and kindness to members of this forum. I do not

                    – In the USA we are going to be overnight shipping all packages that we
                    ship from 11/21-11/25 for FREE. Fedex will not deliver on thanksgiving

                My
                    advice is you can ship it to a Hotel. Just call the hotel and say >I
                    plan to stay at your hotel on xx/xx/xx night can I have a package sent
                    to arrive there to meet me?< Then pick up the package and say you’ll
                    take it out to your car and then >Check In<, and never come back.
                    Works like a charm. Some of my friends get it shipped to their house
                    without issues. its up to you i guess.You can use escrow if you request
                    it. I used it the first time and then just send directly from then on.

                How
                    does receiving a shipment work, do you ship to buyers residential
                    addresses? That takes away from it being >anonymous< and makes it
                    easy for people to get caught . Trying to gather information before I
                    give this a try it seems sketch. Those who have purchased do you do
                    escrow, how do you receive your shipment?Reply

                I
                    work as a Bartender, it is very normal for me to get big wads of cash
                    like what Jeff sent me. I still love it though:)2 weeks ago I had a guy
                    tell me I was a failure of a woman because I didnt want kids and its my
                    job to stay home, have kids and clean. I also had a guy tell me
                    >Once your done working here, you can come over to my place and do
                    some real work< LOLReply

                    way for a long while. As you all know we are caught up on shipping and
                    all packages go out the same day if we get payment before 2PM ESTJohn –
                    We just started offering Euro yesterday. No one has ordered Euro

                    is a good idea? Sure if you want to go to jail for 20-25 years and pay a
                    $250,000 fine. Being a coke dealer in a foreign neighborhood would be
                    less stressful than counterfeiting. Trust me I have experienceReply

                    traffic is skyrocketing. We have to increase our prices to reduce
                    order’s and not fall behind like we did last week. We are 100% caught up
                    by the way.We are now offering Euro through our website. The prices are
                    a little worse than the USD because it takes more work/cost to exchange

                    websites are legit until you do a big order? Like >Bitcoinfog< is
                    legit until you send more than 1btc and then they rob you. Is Cash Is

                    from these guys on 10/14, 10/26 & 11/16. Will they send the

                I
                    cant believe this is happening. I ordered the $10k package and got it
                    today – 100x$100 bills. Now I just placed the order for the Pro!
                    Thats 1000x$100 bills! Its getting fucking REAL!!Reply

                You’ll
                    never find a Silver Certificate Bill anymore. You can find rare serial
                    #’s like >000001< or >1234…< They can be few worth a little
                    more than the face value. But I think the bank tellers snag all the good
                    ones before they get to the public.Reply

                Most
                    of the cash I got was in good shape but a few $20’s didn’t go through
                    the ATM. I emailed mr >ace< about it and said he sent me
                    replacements today. Its weird to have decent customer service on the
                    dark net. Most vendors are faggots. Lets see if the replacements really
                    come thoughNow I have to wait a week and a half before I can order
                    another package. Jeff any chance you’ll relax that >You can only
                    order every 2 weeks< policy? That sucks I could really use another
                    $2,500 before this next weekend.Reply

                    surprised no one has disagreed with you yet. But now that Trump is in

                    do you think about excluding them from being allowed to order? And maybe

                Jeff
                    I would like to make a suggestion that will better this whole
                    community. Take a look and you will notice all the negativity on your
                    forum is coming from #1: Non-White people #2: Elderly #3: Women. If you
                    disallow those groups from ordering it will improve your whole
                    operation. The biggest problem with selling to women like Samantha,
                    Laurette F, Juicelatte ext… is this: If their on the internet then they
                    are not doing their duties in the house, kitchen and with the children.
                    You are destroying families man. And selling to non-white people is the
                    same as directly funding gangs, terrorism and unplanned parenthood.
                    Thanks for the most recent package, the cash is always appreciated and
                    is going toward funding a great cause.Reply

                    that whole story. What the hell possesed you to pay 32,150 for a car
                    when you dont have any way to prove to the system you earned it.
                    Anything over 9,999 (i think) they have to report your dumd ass. Why not
                    just make the payments and build your credit. Then you would still have
                    money and not be on anyone’s radar. AND THEN!!! You decide to tell them
                    where you got it from like some piece of shit ignorant ass snitch. You
                    deserved all of that and i hope you learned your fucking lesson. Young
                    people aren’t the problem. Its the sheer ignorance of sheep like you.

            Mr. ChesterNovember 10, 2017 at 7:29 am
                Recently
                    the post office delivered $100k from this kind mans organization. I
                    still don’t understand the young peoples fascination with the blocks
                    coin. It aint real unless you can hold it in your hands and examine it
                    up and down. But my daughter is so intelligent she could win an award,
                    she helps me order some medicinal pills from a market on the interweb.
                    She helped me place an order with this gentleman organization and I have
                    a really big problem that may need to be discussed with the committee.I
                    received a package full of Benjamin Franklin’s from Mr. Jeff and then
                    thought to myself >Go get while the gettin’s good. I’m going to buy
                    myself a new pickup for my transportation around town< so I took a
                    stroll down to the local dealership, met a very nice man named Jack and
                    he showed me some new pickup trucks. After careful review and
                    examination of the vehicles I picked one I fancied. I asked Mr. Jack the
                    dealer >Young Man, How much for this truck?< and he said >Well
                    sir that one has a sticker on its window for $26,540<. I said to
                    Jack the dealer >Jack you are a gentlemen and a scholar, this razzes
                    my berries, I’ll take it.< I go to pay for the pickup and discovered
                    the price increased to $32,150. He explained the add is to cover taxes
                    as well as >Processing Fee’s, Dealer Prep, Deliver Charge, Lot fee
                    & Advertising fee.< I could tell he was an honest man so I agreed
                    to the charges. Then I opened my briefcase and counted out $32,150 in
                    cash on the table. And that’s every they get real serious and asked
                    where I got the money and called the police who took it away! I even
                    explained I purchased it from a reputable website on the inter web. Well
                    now as you can all probably tell I’m as pissed as a three legged coon.
                    You young people have ruined the nation I worked hard to build! I cant
                    even buy a car without being investigated and thieved.I would like a
                    refund of my block coins. You have done me wrong, gotten me in trouble

                Hello
                    just wanted to chime in. I am new to the $100k week club but why are we
                    being penalized because all the small orders are bogging the system
                    down? I suggest we have the only available package be the $100k for $5k
                    option. That way you’ll weed out all the children from your
                    operation.I’m sure I’ll get some anti-jew comments for this but why
                    should I have to suffer because the poor don’t have enough money?-SteinReply

                Hey
                    Anonymous – Good question. We are currently debating raising the
                    minimum to $2,500 cash for $500 btc. That should reduce the order volume
                    enough to meet all our shipment commitments perfectly instead of a few
                    running a day or two behind.We are also considering making a new policy
                    that only 1 order can be placed every two weeks. If we made this a
                    policy we would raise the maximum order size to $200,000. We cant have
                    new policies hurting our most dedicated customers after all. Do any of
                    the $100k / week guys want to chime in with your thoughts on these
                    policy changes?Jeff AdminReply

                I’ve
                    only ordered the $25,000 and not the $100k package for financial
                    reasons. After they arrive for whatever reason I am not able to save the
                    $5,000 for the $100,000 package. Thats the goal though. You’ll probably
                    see another $10,000 or $25,000 order here in the next day or so. Money
                    spends FAST.Getting $25,000 in the mail almost feels as good as
                    Morphine. Its a real genuine >High< feeling.Reply

                    usable. I deposited $500 at my bank through an ATM to test the money.

                    I placed an order November 28th, provided shipping address and paid the
                    proper bitcoin address, 20hrs later I received a confirmation and
                    tracking information for the package. I received the shipment itself
                    11/1/16. All of that went fine but my package was supposed to have
                    $25,000 but only contained $24,500. I emailed you about it and you said
                    you would send me $1,000 extra in my next order. I want you to make it
                    right – now. You shorted me man and I need that $500. Do the right

                    a couple hundred dollars than a couple hundred thousand dollars finding
                    out. Ive seen some crazy shit during my 40+ years on this earth. I

                    fore the apple2 then updated the computers to apple2 to write code for
                    the apple2e and so on and on. This is a fuct up world where if you dont
                    look you wont find. the machine prints money like its not even real so
                    lets do our part and use as much of it as we can before it turns into a

                Another
                    message for SOME posting here:Holy shit! If these guys are multiplying
                    your money by at least 4X, and it works, why are there still
                    complaints?If you’re relying on them to get your order to you per some
                    deadline to pay your bills, maybe a long-term outlook might work better.
                    I’m looking at starting at the bottom with what we can afford, then
                    working our way up the >ladder<.If you think missing >A<
                    payment because a shipment didn’t arrive >on time< is bad,
                    consider the situation my wife and I are in. We’re now behind on almost
                    ALL of our obligations, largely due to the increasingly fucked-up
                    government >system< that handles care homes like the one we used
                    to operate. We literally have nowhere to go but up at this point.Most of
                    anything we would pay for with money from Cash is King is already late,
                    anyway, but I’m starting to figure a long-term strategy might just get
                    us caught-up, bit-by-bit, until we’ve settled our obligations and clawed
                    ourselves out of the red.It seems to me like some of the complaints
                    I’ve read are from folks who might not appreciate what being >royally
                    fucked< REALLY means. My wife and I sure as hell do, but we’re
                    looking for something that will help us out of our fix over time, not
                    for someone to mollycoddle us.Reply

                ACE:Your
                    >FAQ< response about having no sympathy for the sick/disabled
                    gave me the first real laugh I’ve had in a while; THANKS!Until recently
                    my wife & I operated an adult foster home, taking care of 2 disabled
                    adults who lived with us 24/7/365. Did that since ’02. Most of our
                    clients had fucked-up their lives with alcohol & drugs and preyed on
                    those weaker than them, and no other caregivers would take them. Worked
                    fine while >the system< made them at least take a stab at wearing
                    >big boy pants<. NOW >the system< just allows them to be
                    pussies & looks-out for their >happiness<, so when they want
                    to move because of others being >all up in their business<, they
                    just get what they want. No consideration for the effect it has on
                    us/our finances.Long story short: less than 2 months after my wife was
                    nominated for an award in recognition of her excellence as a care home
                    operator over the last 13+ years, we don’t even have enough money to pay
                    attention.The more I review your site, the more I’m thinking your
                    service might be just what the doctor ordered. Good chance I’ll be in
                    touch soon.Reply

                    The cash was vacuum sealed inside a non-transparent bag with a big label
                    on it reading >First Edition of Fahrenheit 451< and >Do not
                    expose to oxygen until ready<. All the cash even felt like a big
                    thick book when vacuum sealed also. The cash was in good condition, no
                    bills in really bad shape.Very pleased you just made a repeat customer!!Reply

                    are a real pain you know that? Order the $25k/$100k package and dont
                    depend on the $1200 or $2,500 package to get there in the nick of time!!
                    Plan ahead! We are overworked trying to hook everyone up with their
                    cash and its people like you that make it really difficult.If you keep
                    complaining we’re going to make the minimum package the $5,000 for $750
                    so we ship fewer packages and can do it faster. We’ll ignore your whiney
                    emails saying >Its too expensive for us now< and then where will
                    you be? Unable to pay your bills praying to the almighty Hillary Clinton

                Jeff
                    – I speak for the whole community here. You know me I’ve been a buyer
                    with you since the start. Lots of people depend on you guys for cash
                    each week. There are REAL PEOPLE behind each order. Respectfully can you
                    please try to ship all packages the same day as their order? Sometimes
                    it takes 2 days and that really hurts people sometimes. I missed paying
                    my car payment once because your overnight shipping took 2 days. How
                    does that happen man? Overnight shipping takes 1 day. It took 2 days
                    because you didnt ship it fast enough. Again – I like you and you’re a
                    true dealer but try to buckle it in a little, you’ve created a community
                    that depends on you.– BigDickProblemsReply

                If
                    the comments/review section here is by real customers, why doesn’t
                    anyone use dates so we can get comfortable knowing when the last order
                    was successfully made? C’mon people! Add the date to when you post a
                    review here so potential customers will see that you had a great order
                    processed.Reply

                placed
                    my order last and got a tracking confirmation 10 hours later. kind of
                    slow response time right? followed the tracking until it showed up
                    today. I ordered the $5,000 package and he gave me $5,500 which is nice.

                They
                    recommend an escrow which actually is reliable, after you place an
                    order they immediately send you tracking information.The escrow is
                    legit. I did a careful evaluation with several test orders and its the
                    real deal.I order the $10,000 package every single week. But I hate
                    these faggots for having such a good operation. Am sure they will delete

                Brad just could be a godsend to most of us who are living paycheck to
                    paycheck while the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. Finally
                    someone has come up with a real product for the average person. STOP
                    LIVING FROM PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK and supplement (or replace) your
                    income!! Could you use a little bit (or maybe a LOT) of extra cash each
                    month? And wouldnâ€™t it be great to be able to get that extra cash
                    without having to get another job?â€™ This is worth trying â€> the
                    cost is negligible and the results are a hefty support of much needed
                    â€˜extra cashâ€™.Reply

                    sending out money. I dont know if this is a scam or not but I DO get
                    legit cash in the mail.Reply

                Originally,
                    I was skeptical of this product and its claim about being Risk Free
                    Cash. I have tried many online financial products that alluded to
                    similar claims only to be disappointed in the long-run. So, I figured
                    that I’d give this product the ultimate test: make a purchase and
                    deposit it at an ATM. I sent an email to cashgod and about 12 hours
                    later they responded. Someone will get back to you but itâ€™s not as
                    quick as I think it could be. He emailed back to my request asking where
                    I wanted it shipped, what name to put on it, payment instructions ext..
                    I sent the bitcoins and it took another day for him to confirm the
                    package had been sent. At this point Iâ€™m unhappy because I feel the
                    responses are slow. And then the package arrived and my whole world
                    changed. I canâ€™t describe how good it feels to hold a big wad of cash.
                    I took my cash and deposited it at the bank without any issues. Then I
                    paid my rent and filled my fridge with food / beer. I called in sick at
                    work and took the rest of the week off. I canâ€™t describe the freedom I
                    felt laying on my couch with a pile of money in my bank. I highly
                    recommend this product. I have never had any issues with spending this
                    money, depositing it in ATMs or banks. Since then I have purchased 4 of
                    the $20k option and am living the life I deserve.Reply

                    wanted to express my apologies on this forum that I got so upset with
                    cashgod. I put in my order, sent the bitcoins and wanted an
                    immediate response. When you didn’t send a shipping notice within 24
                    hours I sent all those mean emails. Then you explained exactly all the
                    issues you were having and you promised (& delivered) with sending
                    me the shipping notice that same day. The cash arrived and I was
                    extremely pleased with the good condition of the cash. You have a long
                    term customer. Thank you kindly for your patience and product you have
                    helped me and my entire family. Your awesome!Reply
