There are many people in situations where it is within their, or our, interest to be armed, but being caught with a weapon would be incriminating.Three of the solutions of this are:>hiding the existence of the weapon (generally ineffective if they are aware you may possess weapons, could be effective if no-one is doing a thorough search)>hiding the purpose of weapon (obfuscation: think of a walking cane with a weapon concealed within. Probably ineffective if they know what they are looking for or are doing a thorough search)>plausible deniability: having a believable excuse for possessing the weapon, or its components, at least if not in extreme amounts ("I have ammonium nitrate to fertilize my plants", "I have potassium nitrate as stump remover and sugar as a cooking ingredient", "I have petroleum in plastic cans from when fuel prices skyrocketed", "I am legally allowed to own airsoft rifles for recreational purposes", "Vodka isn't illegal and nor are old rags I need when painting.")What are some plausibly deniable weapons? For the sake of slow board, it's fine to list highly-available typical protest weapons like Molotov cocktails (alcohol/petroleum are usually legal and unsuspicious when disassembled), laser beams and power-tools like nail guns, but I'm curious to see what the most useful weapons are that are completely unsuspicious when disassembled.Example scenario: pigs know you are an organized radical anti-capitalist and find an excuse to do a general search, hoping to find drugs or unregistered guns or something. What, in it's disassembled form if necessary, could evade their suspicion?Anonymous 2022-06-23 (Thu) 12:12:49 No.2189                     >>2188>What, in it's disassembled form if necessary, could evade their suspicion?A metal bike lock can fuck someone up, but you need to have a bike for someone to not question itBaseball bat is good too. Keep some softballs and a glove in your car so you have plausible deniabilityA pocket knife with a small blade, something where you can legally carry it around.The problem you're gonna run into here is twofold. One, cops are smart and pretty good at figuring out if something is able to be quickly assembled and used as a weapon. Two, having the components of a weapon quickly available to assemble oftentimes can get you charged with conspiracy or intent to commit a crime. Having a bunch of nitric acid and hexamine tablets isn't going to look good if you're not a chemist/outdoorsman combo. Hell, a plastic auto sear is legally a machine gun even if you don't own a firearm to put it in.Really though, if you're seriously considering maiming or killing someone as a political statement, then go big or go home because you're clearly past the point of caring about plausible deniability.Anonymous 2022-06-23 (Thu) 14:52:51 No.2190                     >>2189Good point, but that's where having a good lawyer would come in.

If it's very important to you, make sure to not track residues into your home or on your clothes if you cannot afford to get caught and you think you could be searched. There are levels to it though, and you should 100% try to learn what cops generally do for what crimes, and what departments would be involved in your crimes (e.g. local police, parole officer, state troopers, highway patrol, FBI, ATF, border patrol). If you want to find info/lit on this stuff, probably go check around militant eco anarchist spaces (Tor pls), since they're the ones in the west doing sketchy shit and trying to pass on knowledge to other activists.Anonymous 2022-07-15 (Fri) 08:41:14 No.2283                     Living in a rural area would allow you the legal excuse of needing a rifle as means of controlling feral animals.

It's machinery that gets you sub-millimeter precision for things like production processes as well for maybe, what, $400, all said and done with an MSLA printer? And you don't need a very big group working them.

Alright, so I won't go too much into it, but as I'm sure you've all noticed, there is a distinct lack of competent organizations and combat readiness in the left. While it may just be a stereotype, the idea of the skinny and weak anarchist can sum up most of the left that wishes to engage in direct action, mostly by using outdated manuals and romanticized ideas of war. As such, I had, a few years ago, taken it upon myself to release training videos to some of you in order to get you up to speed on the basics of the basics. That, unfortunately, seems to have fallen through on the account of my job, which often has me traveling and doing other things that I won't go into because they are totally uninteresting and unrelated to the topic at hand. As such, we will go into a few key steps you should be taking in order to prepare yourself for introductory training, should it ever be offered to you. Yes, you read that correctly, you must train yourself to be trained. You do not have the luxury of being part of an organized military force, though I would not critique you if that is the route you are wanting to take, as it would be hypocritical. I will limit the topic to individual training, equipment, and self-selection because the whole of military science is a broad topic that is not wholly known by any one individual. Please understand this so that my limitations do not become a hindrance to your growth as a potential combat soldier. Seek training from experienced individuals, even if you have to hide your power level. Consider me just another voice on the internet. I do not intend to use credentials or authority on the subject to get you to do as I say, but I would appreciate it if you thought about a few things. Thank you for reading.69 posts and 12 image replies omitted.

Info tied to your real name online can be picked by an algorithm. A union vote or workplace politics will have your name on it, but it's fairly milquetoast and you can play the social democrat. The "assigned FBI agent" thing is a meme, in reality your biggest danger is any kind of automated surveillance, and provided you avoid that, you should be fine.Anonymous 2022-07-10 (Sun) 20:30:19 No.2257                     >>1270Do not buy an AK. I physically cringe whenever I see any leftist with an AK because it indicates to me that said person is motivated primarily by larp/aesthetics rather than practicality.AR's are cheaper in the US, they will have parts and training compatibility with most other people, furthermore, they are more ergonomic(safety, bolt, ease of mounting optics and lights) and ballistically superior (hence everyone moving over to a 5.56-like cartridge from EU to China).The AR-15 is the people's weapon of the United States.

There isn't much material over it on youtuber, but from what I gather, it's a materialist approach to warfare. Instead of the classical Prussian doctrine of encirclement, deep operations focuses on breaking through to the back line and destroying communications and supply lines, which greatly help other areas of the line besides your own immediate victory, which the blitzkrieg focused on.7 posts and 15 image replies omitted.

Their closer proximity to the steppe gave them greater interest and access to the Mongolian campaigns, first analyzed by the Russian General Mikhail Ivanin in the 19th century, which became a recommended text in the Russian military academies up until the mid 20th century. Ivanin's work became used in the Deep Battle doctrine developed by Soviet Marshal Mikhail Tukhachevsky, Mikhail Frunze, and G. S. Isserson. Deep Battle doctrine bore a heavy resemblance to Mongol strategic methods, substituting tanks, motorized troop carriers, artillery, and airplanes for Mongol horse archers, lancers, and field artillery. The Red Army even went so far as to copy Subutai's use of smokescreens on the battlefield to cover troop movements. Later in the 20th century, American military theorist John Boyd and some of his followers used Genghis Khan and Subutai's campaigns as examples of maneuver warfare.<Gabriel, Richard A. (2004).

Some generals were very attached to the cavalry and fought every attempt to modernize with tanks and other armored vehicles.Anonymous  2021-11-28 (Sun) 12:28:09 No.109                     >>108Let's not exagerrate the scale of the problem here. While it is true that Stalin's base of support in the Red Army was the "Cavalry Clique", the one who really resolutely opposed modernization was Budyonny, who had a big voice because he was a civil war hero.Ignoring that, the territory of the USSR favoured cavalry heavily, and this was helped by the offensive doctrine of the Red Army.  In the civil war, where echelon warfare failed, it was up to the cavalrymen with their sabres to exploit breakthroughs and cause morale shocks. It worked, which is why the Cavalry Clique came to the forefront in the first place. And before the rapid industrialization, it was only a dream to convert all soviet cavalry corps to motorized units let alone tanks. By WW2 most cavalry usefulness was gone, but we should note that Italian cavalry managed to defeat a soviet force 3 times their size due to their cavalry patrols noticing the Soviet unit and giving the initiative to the Italians.Anonymous 2022-07-10 (Sun) 19:14:46 No.2254                     bump                File: 1656094374860.jpg (166.31 KB, 1280x906, cat.jpg)        Anonymous 2022-06-24 (Fri) 18:12:55 No.2195[Reply]hmmm today… i will post my favorite cat15 posts and 18 image replies omitted.
