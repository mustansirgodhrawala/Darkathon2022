Based on a recipe I used when I was younger, I've made a few variations of this but not had the forethought to write most of them down. Does work reasonably well with pears used in place of apples though

Ingredients


1 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/2 cup finely chopped walnuts
4 eggs, separated
1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar
1 1/2 cups sugar, divided
1/4 cup sweetened apple juice
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1/2 teaspoon grated lemon peel


Method


Pre-heat oven to 180C
In medium bowl, sift together flour, baking powder, cinnamon and cloves
Stir in walnuts and then set aside
In large mixing bowl, beat egg whites with cream of tartar at high speed until thick and foamy
Add 1/2 cup of sugar 2 tablespoons at a time, beating constantly until sugar is dissolved and whites are glossy and peaking
In small mixing bowl, beat egg yolks at high speed until thick and lemon-colored
Gradually beat in 1/2 cup of sugar
Sprinkle flour mixture over whites and add the beaten yolk mixture
Gently fold yolk mixture into whites, but be thorough
Grease a 10-inch pan and pour mixture in
Spread mixture evenly over pan
Bake until for about 45 to 50 minutes - until the top is springy
Allow to cool completely before attempting to remove from pan
In small saucepan, stir together apple juice, remaining sugar, lemon juice and lemon peel
Cook over a medium-high heat, stirring constantly, and bring to boil.
Remove from heat
Slowly spoon syrup over cake until the mixture has been absorbed
