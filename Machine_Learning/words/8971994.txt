Hidden Services – Other Protocols
Volunteers last verified that all services in this section were up, or marked as DOWN, on: 2011-06-08
For configuration and service/uptime testing, all services in this section MUST list the active port in their address. Exception: HTTP on 80, HTTPS on 443.
For help with configuration, see the TorifyHOWTO and End-to-end connectivity issues.
P2P FileSharing
Running P2P protocols within Tor requires OnionCat. Therefore, see the OnionCat section for those P2P services.
IMPORTANT: It is possible to use Tor for P2P. However, if you do, the right thing must also be done by giving back the bandwidth used. Otherwise, if this is not done, Tor will be crushed taking everyone along with it.
Chat centric services
Some people and their usual server hangouts may be found in the Contact Directory.
