      ACAB Forum: Abolish Police Message Board




          ALL COPS ARE BAD
Let's Unmake All Relations Of Policing
Cops are the domestic wing of the state's monopoly of violence. They don't do what they say they do.
Content Warning: much of what is posted here includes descriptions of terrible harm by police, more often than not done to marginalised groups and with no accountability.
More on why we want to abolish the police and all state-capitalist criminal justice systems at our nascent ACAB Wiki, and check out aWorldWithoutPolice.org.
What To Do Instead Of Calling The Police
Also, de-arrests are beautiful.
Soundtrack included.
