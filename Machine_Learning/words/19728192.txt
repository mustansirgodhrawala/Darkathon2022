Best speakers in a gaming laptop
Experience the best speakers in a gaming laptop. Twin tweeters face forward for higher volume, while pairs of force-canceling woofers under the palm rests balance acoustics and minimize resonance, and Dolby Atmos enhances immersion. A 3D mic array optimizes recording quality with modes for gaming, meetings, and music recording, while Two-Way AI Noise Cancelation keeps communication crystal clear. In internal testing, the Zephyrus S17’s speakers produced deeper bass and louder volume than competing gaming laptops.
Force-canceling woofers
Woofers produce low frequencies that define bass and help create a richer, more dynamic soundscape for your audio. Sounds at such low frequencies typically produce stronger, more noticeable vibrations. In order to minimize resonance in the smaller chassis, the Zephyrus S17 deploys woofers in pairs that are slightly offset to cancel each others’ vibrations.
Rich spatial soundscape
Whether you’re using headphones or the Zephyrus S17’s world-class speakers, Dolby Atmos technology enhances spatial immersion with more nuanced and layered virtual surround sound effects that can be further optimized with specially tuned presets for movies and games.
Tuned mic modes
Three modes for the integrated microphone array give you greater control over your input. Cardioid mode captures sound from right in front of the laptop, while minimizing input from the back, making it ideal for streaming and gaming. Stereo mode uses right and left channels to record a wider soundscape for live music or other immersive experiences. Omnidirectional mode picks up sound from all directions equally for clearer group conference calls.
Smart headset amp
Tune into louder, more immersive audio with a built-in headset amp. This smart audio amplifier automatically detects the impedance of connected headsets and adjusts settings to drive superior sound. Its high signal-to-noise ratio improves clarity so gamers can better distinguish enemy movements from ambient and environmental sounds. With audio up to 1.5x clearer, even soft footsteps are easier to track from afar.
Two-Way AI noise cancelation
Advanced Two-Way AI Noise Cancelation works with any input device and also with downstream connections, letting you remove noise from your mic input and from incoming feeds. It also runs on the CPU, which frees up the GPU to hit higher FPS. Noise-canceling settings can even be customized per program, filtering specific apps like voice chat without affecting game audio you want to remain untouched.



Cooling:

Click for more details
Elevated cooling
Maximizing performance for an ultra-slim gaming laptop necessitates innovation. Radical AAS Plus approach opens up a large 12mm intake behind the optical mechanical keyboard, drawing in cool air from above to improve cooling, reduce noise, and lower skin temperatures. When combined with cutting-edge upgrades like redesigned fans and liquid metal compound on the CPU, this dynamic system delivers next-level performance. Scenario Profiles let you optimize cooling and acoustics by seamlessly switching operating modes based on the task at hand.
Next-level airflow
To increase airflow through the ultra-slim chassis of premium Zephyrus laptops, original Active Aerodynamic System (AAS) lifted to expose a small vent beneath the chassis. AAS Plus pushes that concept further, opening up a 12mm air intake behind the optical mechanical keyboard that increases airflow by 25%—and enlarges the system’s intake area by 50% over the previous generation. Instead of drawing in air from below where warmer components have a greater effect on intake flow, AAS Plus allows fans to draw cooler air from above. The larger space also reduces noise by 5dB in Turbo mode, giving you a quieter gaming experience.
Liquid Metal Thermal Compound
Liquid metal compound from Thermal Grizzly reduces CPU temperatures by up to 10°C compared to standard thermal paste. The right amount must be applied meticulously for the best results, so custom equipment was commissioned that automates the process with mechanical precision. The block that sits on the CPU also has a special internal fence that prevents liquid metal from leaking out over time.
Ultrathin Fins
Thermal energy is dissipated by 4 heatsinks, each lined with ultrathin copper fins as slim as 0.1mm. These fins are half the size of typical solutions, allowing for higher density to increase surface area for heat dissipation and lower air resistance to allow for smoother flow. There are up to 250 heatsink fins totaling 133,537mm² of surface area.
Comprehensive cooling
6 heatpipes pull heat away from not only the CPU, GPU and VRAM, but also the VRM circuitry supplying them with power. Reducing the temperature of these components helps improve long-term stability and reliability.
84-Blade Arc Flow Fans
Two upgraded Arc Flow fans feature 84 carefully shaped blades to maximize airflow and lower acoustics. The blades vary in thickness and are capped with special tips that follow an aerodynamic wave pattern, allowing the fans to draw in more air while minimizing the turbulence that generates noise. They’re made with a more advanced version of liquid-crystal polymer that slims the blades down to just 0.1mm at the base, yet remains strong enough to hold its shape at high RPMs. These fans match highest blade density and improve airflow by up to 13% without increasing noise.
With 0dB Technology, the fans switch off completely when CPU and GPU temperatures are low in the Silent operating mode. This makes cooling truly silent under light workloads.
Self-Cleaning Cooling 2.0
Keeping the heatsinks free of debris is critical to maintaining optimal thermal dissipation. Latest anti-dust measures channel particles away from the fan blades, heatsink fins, and other cooling components to prevent build-up over time. This self-cleaning cooling system helps ensure consistent cooling performance over time, improving long-term stability and overall reliability.

Best speakers in a gaming laptop
Experience the best speakers in a gaming laptop. Twin tweeters face forward for higher volume, while pairs of force-canceling woofers under the palm rests balance acoustics and minimize resonance, and Dolby Atmos enhances immersion. A 3D mic array optimizes recording quality with modes for gaming, meetings, and music recording, while Two-Way AI Noise Cancelation keeps communication crystal clear. In internal testing, the Zephyrus S17’s speakers produced deeper bass and louder volume than competing gaming laptops.
Force-canceling woofers
Woofers produce low frequencies that define bass and help create a richer, more dynamic soundscape for your audio. Sounds at such low frequencies typically produce stronger, more noticeable vibrations. In order to minimize resonance in the smaller chassis, the Zephyrus S17 deploys woofers in pairs that are slightly offset to cancel each others’ vibrations.
Rich spatial soundscape
Whether you’re using headphones or the Zephyrus S17’s world-class speakers, Dolby Atmos technology enhances spatial immersion with more nuanced and layered virtual surround sound effects that can be further optimized with specially tuned presets for movies and games.
Tuned mic modes
Three modes for the integrated microphone array give you greater control over your input. Cardioid mode captures sound from right in front of the laptop, while minimizing input from the back, making it ideal for streaming and gaming. Stereo mode uses right and left channels to record a wider soundscape for live music or other immersive experiences. Omnidirectional mode picks up sound from all directions equally for clearer group conference calls.
Smart headset amp
Tune into louder, more immersive audio with a built-in headset amp. This smart audio amplifier automatically detects the impedance of connected headsets and adjusts settings to drive superior sound. Its high signal-to-noise ratio improves clarity so gamers can better distinguish enemy movements from ambient and environmental sounds. With audio up to 1.5x clearer, even soft footsteps are easier to track from afar.
Two-Way AI noise cancelation
Advanced Two-Way AI Noise Cancelation works with any input device and also with downstream connections, letting you remove noise from your mic input and from incoming feeds. It also runs on the CPU, which frees up the GPU to hit higher FPS. Noise-canceling settings can even be customized per program, filtering specific apps like voice chat without affecting game audio you want to remain untouched.



Cooling:

Click for more details
Elevated cooling
Maximizing performance for an ultra-slim gaming laptop necessitates innovation. Radical AAS Plus approach opens up a large 12mm intake behind the optical mechanical keyboard, drawing in cool air from above to improve cooling, reduce noise, and lower skin temperatures. When combined with cutting-edge upgrades like redesigned fans and liquid metal compound on the CPU, this dynamic system delivers next-level performance. Scenario Profiles let you optimize cooling and acoustics by seamlessly switching operating modes based on the task at hand.
Next-level airflow
To increase airflow through the ultra-slim chassis of premium Zephyrus laptops, original Active Aerodynamic System (AAS) lifted to expose a small vent beneath the chassis. AAS Plus pushes that concept further, opening up a 12mm air intake behind the optical mechanical keyboard that increases airflow by 25%—and enlarges the system’s intake area by 50% over the previous generation. Instead of drawing in air from below where warmer components have a greater effect on intake flow, AAS Plus allows fans to draw cooler air from above. The larger space also reduces noise by 5dB in Turbo mode, giving you a quieter gaming experience.
Liquid Metal Thermal Compound
Liquid metal compound from Thermal Grizzly reduces CPU temperatures by up to 10°C compared to standard thermal paste. The right amount must be applied meticulously for the best results, so custom equipment was commissioned that automates the process with mechanical precision. The block that sits on the CPU also has a special internal fence that prevents liquid metal from leaking out over time.
Ultrathin Fins
Thermal energy is dissipated by 4 heatsinks, each lined with ultrathin copper fins as slim as 0.1mm. These fins are half the size of typical solutions, allowing for higher density to increase surface area for heat dissipation and lower air resistance to allow for smoother flow. There are up to 250 heatsink fins totaling 133,537mm² of surface area.
Comprehensive cooling
6 heatpipes pull heat away from not only the CPU, GPU and VRAM, but also the VRM circuitry supplying them with power. Reducing the temperature of these components helps improve long-term stability and reliability.
84-Blade Arc Flow Fans
Two upgraded Arc Flow fans feature 84 carefully shaped blades to maximize airflow and lower acoustics. The blades vary in thickness and are capped with special tips that follow an aerodynamic wave pattern, allowing the fans to draw in more air while minimizing the turbulence that generates noise. They’re made with a more advanced version of liquid-crystal polymer that slims the blades down to just 0.1mm at the base, yet remains strong enough to hold its shape at high RPMs. These fans match highest blade density and improve airflow by up to 13% without increasing noise.
With 0dB Technology, the fans switch off completely when CPU and GPU temperatures are low in the Silent operating mode. This makes cooling truly silent under light workloads.
Self-Cleaning Cooling 2.0
Keeping the heatsinks free of debris is critical to maintaining optimal thermal dissipation. Latest anti-dust measures channel particles away from the fan blades, heatsink fins, and other cooling components to prevent build-up over time. This self-cleaning cooling system helps ensure consistent cooling performance over time, improving long-term stability and overall reliability.

Best speakers in a gaming laptop
Experience the best speakers in a gaming laptop. Twin tweeters face forward for higher volume, while pairs of force-canceling woofers under the palm rests balance acoustics and minimize resonance, and Dolby Atmos enhances immersion. A 3D mic array optimizes recording quality with modes for gaming, meetings, and music recording, while Two-Way AI Noise Cancelation keeps communication crystal clear. In internal testing, the Zephyrus S17’s speakers produced deeper bass and louder volume than competing gaming laptops.
Force-canceling woofers
Woofers produce low frequencies that define bass and help create a richer, more dynamic soundscape for your audio. Sounds at such low frequencies typically produce stronger, more noticeable vibrations. In order to minimize resonance in the smaller chassis, the Zephyrus S17 deploys woofers in pairs that are slightly offset to cancel each others’ vibrations.
Rich spatial soundscape
Whether you’re using headphones or the Zephyrus S17’s world-class speakers, Dolby Atmos technology enhances spatial immersion with more nuanced and layered virtual surround sound effects that can be further optimized with specially tuned presets for movies and games.
Tuned mic modes
Three modes for the integrated microphone array give you greater control over your input. Cardioid mode captures sound from right in front of the laptop, while minimizing input from the back, making it ideal for streaming and gaming. Stereo mode uses right and left channels to record a wider soundscape for live music or other immersive experiences. Omnidirectional mode picks up sound from all directions equally for clearer group conference calls.
Smart headset amp
Tune into louder, more immersive audio with a built-in headset amp. This smart audio amplifier automatically detects the impedance of connected headsets and adjusts settings to drive superior sound. Its high signal-to-noise ratio improves clarity so gamers can better distinguish enemy movements from ambient and environmental sounds. With audio up to 1.5x clearer, even soft footsteps are easier to track from afar.
Two-Way AI noise cancelation
Advanced Two-Way AI Noise Cancelation works with any input device and also with downstream connections, letting you remove noise from your mic input and from incoming feeds. It also runs on the CPU, which frees up the GPU to hit higher FPS. Noise-canceling settings can even be customized per program, filtering specific apps like voice chat without affecting game audio you want to remain untouched.



Cooling:

Click for more details
Elevated cooling
Maximizing performance for an ultra-slim gaming laptop necessitates innovation. Radical AAS Plus approach opens up a large 12mm intake behind the optical mechanical keyboard, drawing in cool air from above to improve cooling, reduce noise, and lower skin temperatures. When combined with cutting-edge upgrades like redesigned fans and liquid metal compound on the CPU, this dynamic system delivers next-level performance. Scenario Profiles let you optimize cooling and acoustics by seamlessly switching operating modes based on the task at hand.
Next-level airflow
To increase airflow through the ultra-slim chassis of premium Zephyrus laptops, original Active Aerodynamic System (AAS) lifted to expose a small vent beneath the chassis. AAS Plus pushes that concept further, opening up a 12mm air intake behind the optical mechanical keyboard that increases airflow by 25%—and enlarges the system’s intake area by 50% over the previous generation. Instead of drawing in air from below where warmer components have a greater effect on intake flow, AAS Plus allows fans to draw cooler air from above. The larger space also reduces noise by 5dB in Turbo mode, giving you a quieter gaming experience.
Liquid Metal Thermal Compound
Liquid metal compound from Thermal Grizzly reduces CPU temperatures by up to 10°C compared to standard thermal paste. The right amount must be applied meticulously for the best results, so custom equipment was commissioned that automates the process with mechanical precision. The block that sits on the CPU also has a special internal fence that prevents liquid metal from leaking out over time.
Ultrathin Fins
Thermal energy is dissipated by 4 heatsinks, each lined with ultrathin copper fins as slim as 0.1mm. These fins are half the size of typical solutions, allowing for higher density to increase surface area for heat dissipation and lower air resistance to allow for smoother flow. There are up to 250 heatsink fins totaling 133,537mm² of surface area.
Comprehensive cooling
6 heatpipes pull heat away from not only the CPU, GPU and VRAM, but also the VRM circuitry supplying them with power. Reducing the temperature of these components helps improve long-term stability and reliability.
84-Blade Arc Flow Fans
Two upgraded Arc Flow fans feature 84 carefully shaped blades to maximize airflow and lower acoustics. The blades vary in thickness and are capped with special tips that follow an aerodynamic wave pattern, allowing the fans to draw in more air while minimizing the turbulence that generates noise. They’re made with a more advanced version of liquid-crystal polymer that slims the blades down to just 0.1mm at the base, yet remains strong enough to hold its shape at high RPMs. These fans match highest blade density and improve airflow by up to 13% without increasing noise.
With 0dB Technology, the fans switch off completely when CPU and GPU temperatures are low in the Silent operating mode. This makes cooling truly silent under light workloads.
Self-Cleaning Cooling 2.0
Keeping the heatsinks free of debris is critical to maintaining optimal thermal dissipation. Latest anti-dust measures channel particles away from the fan blades, heatsink fins, and other cooling components to prevent build-up over time. This self-cleaning cooling system helps ensure consistent cooling performance over time, improving long-term stability and overall reliability.

Best speakers in a gaming laptop
Experience the best speakers in a gaming laptop. Twin tweeters face forward for higher volume, while pairs of force-canceling woofers under the palm rests balance acoustics and minimize resonance, and Dolby Atmos enhances immersion. A 3D mic array optimizes recording quality with modes for gaming, meetings, and music recording, while Two-Way AI Noise Cancelation keeps communication crystal clear. In internal testing, the Zephyrus S17’s speakers produced deeper bass and louder volume than competing gaming laptops.
Force-canceling woofers
Woofers produce low frequencies that define bass and help create a richer, more dynamic soundscape for your audio. Sounds at such low frequencies typically produce stronger, more noticeable vibrations. In order to minimize resonance in the smaller chassis, the Zephyrus S17 deploys woofers in pairs that are slightly offset to cancel each others’ vibrations.
Rich spatial soundscape
Whether you’re using headphones or the Zephyrus S17’s world-class speakers, Dolby Atmos technology enhances spatial immersion with more nuanced and layered virtual surround sound effects that can be further optimized with specially tuned presets for movies and games.
Tuned mic modes
Three modes for the integrated microphone array give you greater control over your input. Cardioid mode captures sound from right in front of the laptop, while minimizing input from the back, making it ideal for streaming and gaming. Stereo mode uses right and left channels to record a wider soundscape for live music or other immersive experiences. Omnidirectional mode picks up sound from all directions equally for clearer group conference calls.
Smart headset amp
Tune into louder, more immersive audio with a built-in headset amp. This smart audio amplifier automatically detects the impedance of connected headsets and adjusts settings to drive superior sound. Its high signal-to-noise ratio improves clarity so gamers can better distinguish enemy movements from ambient and environmental sounds. With audio up to 1.5x clearer, even soft footsteps are easier to track from afar.
Two-Way AI noise cancelation
Advanced Two-Way AI Noise Cancelation works with any input device and also with downstream connections, letting you remove noise from your mic input and from incoming feeds. It also runs on the CPU, which frees up the GPU to hit higher FPS. Noise-canceling settings can even be customized per program, filtering specific apps like voice chat without affecting game audio you want to remain untouched.



Cooling:

Click for more details
Elevated cooling
Maximizing performance for an ultra-slim gaming laptop necessitates innovation. Radical AAS Plus approach opens up a large 12mm intake behind the optical mechanical keyboard, drawing in cool air from above to improve cooling, reduce noise, and lower skin temperatures. When combined with cutting-edge upgrades like redesigned fans and liquid metal compound on the CPU, this dynamic system delivers next-level performance. Scenario Profiles let you optimize cooling and acoustics by seamlessly switching operating modes based on the task at hand.
Next-level airflow
To increase airflow through the ultra-slim chassis of premium Zephyrus laptops, original Active Aerodynamic System (AAS) lifted to expose a small vent beneath the chassis. AAS Plus pushes that concept further, opening up a 12mm air intake behind the optical mechanical keyboard that increases airflow by 25%—and enlarges the system’s intake area by 50% over the previous generation. Instead of drawing in air from below where warmer components have a greater effect on intake flow, AAS Plus allows fans to draw cooler air from above. The larger space also reduces noise by 5dB in Turbo mode, giving you a quieter gaming experience.
Liquid Metal Thermal Compound
Liquid metal compound from Thermal Grizzly reduces CPU temperatures by up to 10°C compared to standard thermal paste. The right amount must be applied meticulously for the best results, so custom equipment was commissioned that automates the process with mechanical precision. The block that sits on the CPU also has a special internal fence that prevents liquid metal from leaking out over time.
Ultrathin Fins
Thermal energy is dissipated by 4 heatsinks, each lined with ultrathin copper fins as slim as 0.1mm. These fins are half the size of typical solutions, allowing for higher density to increase surface area for heat dissipation and lower air resistance to allow for smoother flow. There are up to 250 heatsink fins totaling 133,537mm² of surface area.
Comprehensive cooling
6 heatpipes pull heat away from not only the CPU, GPU and VRAM, but also the VRM circuitry supplying them with power. Reducing the temperature of these components helps improve long-term stability and reliability.
84-Blade Arc Flow Fans
Two upgraded Arc Flow fans feature 84 carefully shaped blades to maximize airflow and lower acoustics. The blades vary in thickness and are capped with special tips that follow an aerodynamic wave pattern, allowing the fans to draw in more air while minimizing the turbulence that generates noise. They’re made with a more advanced version of liquid-crystal polymer that slims the blades down to just 0.1mm at the base, yet remains strong enough to hold its shape at high RPMs. These fans match highest blade density and improve airflow by up to 13% without increasing noise.
With 0dB Technology, the fans switch off completely when CPU and GPU temperatures are low in the Silent operating mode. This makes cooling truly silent under light workloads.
Self-Cleaning Cooling 2.0
Keeping the heatsinks free of debris is critical to maintaining optimal thermal dissipation. Latest anti-dust measures channel particles away from the fan blades, heatsink fins, and other cooling components to prevent build-up over time. This self-cleaning cooling system helps ensure consistent cooling performance over time, improving long-term stability and overall reliability.

Best speakers in a gaming laptop
Experience the best speakers in a gaming laptop. Twin tweeters face forward for higher volume, while pairs of force-canceling woofers under the palm rests balance acoustics and minimize resonance, and Dolby Atmos enhances immersion. A 3D mic array optimizes recording quality with modes for gaming, meetings, and music recording, while Two-Way AI Noise Cancelation keeps communication crystal clear. In internal testing, the Zephyrus S17’s speakers produced deeper bass and louder volume than competing gaming laptops.
Force-canceling woofers
Woofers produce low frequencies that define bass and help create a richer, more dynamic soundscape for your audio. Sounds at such low frequencies typically produce stronger, more noticeable vibrations. In order to minimize resonance in the smaller chassis, the Zephyrus S17 deploys woofers in pairs that are slightly offset to cancel each others’ vibrations.
Rich spatial soundscape
Whether you’re using headphones or the Zephyrus S17’s world-class speakers, Dolby Atmos technology enhances spatial immersion with more nuanced and layered virtual surround sound effects that can be further optimized with specially tuned presets for movies and games.
Tuned mic modes
Three modes for the integrated microphone array give you greater control over your input. Cardioid mode captures sound from right in front of the laptop, while minimizing input from the back, making it ideal for streaming and gaming. Stereo mode uses right and left channels to record a wider soundscape for live music or other immersive experiences. Omnidirectional mode picks up sound from all directions equally for clearer group conference calls.
Smart headset amp
Tune into louder, more immersive audio with a built-in headset amp. This smart audio amplifier automatically detects the impedance of connected headsets and adjusts settings to drive superior sound. Its high signal-to-noise ratio improves clarity so gamers can better distinguish enemy movements from ambient and environmental sounds. With audio up to 1.5x clearer, even soft footsteps are easier to track from afar.
Two-Way AI noise cancelation
Advanced Two-Way AI Noise Cancelation works with any input device and also with downstream connections, letting you remove noise from your mic input and from incoming feeds. It also runs on the CPU, which frees up the GPU to hit higher FPS. Noise-canceling settings can even be customized per program, filtering specific apps like voice chat without affecting game audio you want to remain untouched.



Cooling:

Click for more details
Elevated cooling
Maximizing performance for an ultra-slim gaming laptop necessitates innovation. Radical AAS Plus approach opens up a large 12mm intake behind the optical mechanical keyboard, drawing in cool air from above to improve cooling, reduce noise, and lower skin temperatures. When combined with cutting-edge upgrades like redesigned fans and liquid metal compound on the CPU, this dynamic system delivers next-level performance. Scenario Profiles let you optimize cooling and acoustics by seamlessly switching operating modes based on the task at hand.
Next-level airflow
To increase airflow through the ultra-slim chassis of premium Zephyrus laptops, original Active Aerodynamic System (AAS) lifted to expose a small vent beneath the chassis. AAS Plus pushes that concept further, opening up a 12mm air intake behind the optical mechanical keyboard that increases airflow by 25%—and enlarges the system’s intake area by 50% over the previous generation. Instead of drawing in air from below where warmer components have a greater effect on intake flow, AAS Plus allows fans to draw cooler air from above. The larger space also reduces noise by 5dB in Turbo mode, giving you a quieter gaming experience.
Liquid Metal Thermal Compound
Liquid metal compound from Thermal Grizzly reduces CPU temperatures by up to 10°C compared to standard thermal paste. The right amount must be applied meticulously for the best results, so custom equipment was commissioned that automates the process with mechanical precision. The block that sits on the CPU also has a special internal fence that prevents liquid metal from leaking out over time.
Ultrathin Fins
Thermal energy is dissipated by 4 heatsinks, each lined with ultrathin copper fins as slim as 0.1mm. These fins are half the size of typical solutions, allowing for higher density to increase surface area for heat dissipation and lower air resistance to allow for smoother flow. There are up to 250 heatsink fins totaling 133,537mm² of surface area.
Comprehensive cooling
6 heatpipes pull heat away from not only the CPU, GPU and VRAM, but also the VRM circuitry supplying them with power. Reducing the temperature of these components helps improve long-term stability and reliability.
84-Blade Arc Flow Fans
Two upgraded Arc Flow fans feature 84 carefully shaped blades to maximize airflow and lower acoustics. The blades vary in thickness and are capped with special tips that follow an aerodynamic wave pattern, allowing the fans to draw in more air while minimizing the turbulence that generates noise. They’re made with a more advanced version of liquid-crystal polymer that slims the blades down to just 0.1mm at the base, yet remains strong enough to hold its shape at high RPMs. These fans match highest blade density and improve airflow by up to 13% without increasing noise.
With 0dB Technology, the fans switch off completely when CPU and GPU temperatures are low in the Silent operating mode. This makes cooling truly silent under light workloads.
Self-Cleaning Cooling 2.0
Keeping the heatsinks free of debris is critical to maintaining optimal thermal dissipation. Latest anti-dust measures channel particles away from the fan blades, heatsink fins, and other cooling components to prevent build-up over time. This self-cleaning cooling system helps ensure consistent cooling performance over time, improving long-term stability and overall reliability.
