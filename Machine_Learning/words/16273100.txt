If you are using this for persuasion there is an easier technique called NLP (Neuro linguistic programing) I use it all the time and is really effective. Your basically being just like the other person so they like you and trust you. There a plenty of books on the subject.

Stick with the car.
I have both, and although the motorcycle is fun, cheaper, etc, you're so much more vulnerable than in a car. Plus when it rains you don't get wet.

I'm not much of a lad for dark literature, prefer to read Wodehouse, real life is dark enough.
I'd recommend the following though;
Joseph Conrad - Heart of Darkness
Truman Capote - In Cold Blood
Vincent Bugliosi - Helter Skelter

This is not a smart idea at all. First of all the man dosent love you, hes either a pedophile or a child trafficker. He only wants to use you for your naive age and take advantage over you. Not a single 28 year old normal man would even consider being with a 14 year old child. Being in the drug business you meet a lot of fucked up people. And i can assure you, if you go through with this you will either end up on the other side of the border in another country sold into slavery at a cocaine plantation or you will be killed and your organs will be sold. Dont play with these things, report him to your mother before he does bad to you. I hope you find peace and safety in your life.

Subject: Answered: How much Xanax for a decent high?

Rule number 1
Milk is the best DETOX, if you think lorazepam still in your system drink a half a liter of milk and in abt 4hrs it will flush it all out of your body,
Never drink milk before or after any drugs preferably 12hrs before and at least 12hrs after.
Rule Number 2 XANAX + Alcohol of any kind = Suicide attempt that can actually kill you easily if you don't have tolerence to drugs or high metabolism.
Rule Number 3 Since you are actually suffering from anxiety (as myself) you will need more then the subscribed dosage and it all depends on how many Mg yr xanax contains,
lets say 6mg should do you good, take 2mg wait for couple of hours once you feel the buzz add 2mg, if you start feeling sleepy or drowsy don't take anymore, if you feel weakness and drunk like feeling drink a glass of milk to adjust the chemicals in your system, you will still be high but you will minimize the risk.

Buy a chainsaw and start cutting wood whenever you feel like, drink beer and scream at football games. Drive your car like a maniac and/or buy a motorcycle. Kiss a woman infront of your friends (you dont have to like it, just do it). Buy a gun and just shoot at a gunrange or at beer cans. Don't wear gay clothes (this one is the most important).

Subject: Answered: Could hackers save us?



	[Reply]
	[ReplyQuoted]

I take it you mean could black/grey hat hackers save us from the current state of western society? As white hat hackers do protect us by hacking for "good" such as pen testing and whatnot.
If you mean the world then that is  a very difficult question to ask, As the world is such a varied place it would be difficult to save each country or peoples as so many variables and differences.
If it is western society then my answer would be a yes but not a simple yes.
If say a group deletes all debt like in mr robot it would cause absolute chaos across the many countries and even the world. It would break stabilization of not only the worth of currency but the trust into currency which is more crucial as belief in a currency gives it worth. So debt would be a chaotic attempt that in the long term would lead to just outright chaos and mass panic.
If again black/hackers targeted large corporations then the effect would be somewhat self containing to a degree but modern businesses are so interwoven it would have a rippling effect across the economy that could easily extend across borders. Aswell as the long term effects of causing smaller businesses and organizations dependent on the larger taking the collateral for the downfall of said corporations as seen in 2008 and during the recent pandemic. Over time the damage would minimize but not matter the attempt on whatever large corporations at the end of the day should you destroy one, Give it  decade or two and a new one will take its place. Think like the hydra of greek mythos, remove one head, two grow in its place. A never ending battle.
International cyber warfare is effective to a extent as seen with stuxnet, Georgia invasion, Bronze statue incident and most recently colonial pipeline and many others. Whilst effective and possible to cause mass destruction and distablize a country or the whole planet would require a incredible of resources such as Manpower, Equipment and wealth that can really only be accomplished by states themselves. However make no mistake this is happening currently as we are in a cyberwar but no one state will ever truly be the victor imo until A.I, Quantum or advanced technologies beyond our current time are utilized. A Good example of this can be seen with the constant intellectual property theft by china in order to advance their own economical, technological and political position.
So yes in theory it is possible for a hacking group or network to save the world somewhat but the resources, skills and tech required would be very difficult to obtain let alone utilize correctly against organizations, Keep in mind going against organizations such as NSA, GCHQ and the rest would be a incredible challenge as they have tech that we wont see for years.

I am telling you an advice , get away from that guy , there isn't a normal 28 man that will like a 14 years old teen, you don't know what you're dealing with , you're dealing with big things , something suspicious, he may be a pedo or a killer or something like that , i know what I'm saying , listen , the best decision is to get away from him , i am a male and i personality would never like a girl that is half my age.
Since you don't have much friends make some
Think about it
Don't make a bad decision that you will regret later
I'm personally worried about you , i hope you make the best decision and get away from him as soon as possible
