                We keep product labels up to date.
                We try to make all payments using the Escrow service. If the seller does not support escrow, this will be stated in the product description. See the FAQ for more detail.
                For better anonymity, we do not use any Javascript or a comprehensive CMS system.
                No registration is required for the purchase.
                Our system does not hold any sensitive information. After creating the order, the data is encrypted and the purchase takes place via a secure escrow.
                For security reasons, we only accept payments via Bitcoin.
                Escrow uses its own bitcoin mix, so it hides the source of the money.





                Sellers have limited time to deliver the product. Otherwise they will not get paid.
                Payments are made quickly and securely using the escrow service.
                We try to solve all problems or get a statement from the supplier within 24 hours to 48 hours.
                We change states quickly. We do not display sold out or unavailable products.
