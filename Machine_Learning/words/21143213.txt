                        Spiritual Practices That Connect Us to Our Higher Consciousness












                        The Importance of Connecting to our Higher Consciousness
                        Whether we are aware of it or not, our soul‚Äôs greatest desire is to experience a relationship with God, the Lover of our souls. Cultivating such a relationship creates miraculous opportunities not only for us, individually, but for our spheres of influence‚Äîfamily, community, society. This is true because reconnecting with our Higher Consciousness1 not only elevates ourselves but all of life. The world is a reflection of that which takes place within us. As we become more compassionate and selfless, the world is also uplifted. What glorious possibilities!
                        This divine reconnection can be made in many ways. And there is a way that will work for each one of us. All that is needed is desire. These articles are meant to whet the appetite and motivate us to learn more about the practices that facilitate this most vital relationship.
                        Many Ways to Make the Connection with our Solar Presence2



                         Articles on various forms of meditation and visualization, sun-gazing and the science of sacred movement are included in the first set of a series on spiritual practices. Coming soon, look for articles on the science of sound through affirmation, mantra and decrees,3 a deeper understanding of prayer and the power of sacred music to facilitate our connection with the divine.
                        The Ascended Master Djwal Kul4 in a teaching given on February 18th, 2008, talks with us about the value of silent meditation‚Äî‚ÄúThe world is very busy and there is the tendency in the West to supplant busy-ness with spirituality. You can be moving almost at the speed of light and yet on your spiritual path standing still. In stillness you can be emanating the frequencies of love, wisdom and power with the speed of light, co-creating with God a beautiful new world of beingness, truth, understanding‚Ä¶.The goal is union and an understanding of who God is within you.‚Äù
                        May one or several of the spiritual practices we share excite you and open up possibilities to experience life as it was meant to be lived‚Äîin joy and in victory as co-creators with a loving God who desires only the best for us. If you already engage in a spiritual practice, maybe more than one, we hope you discover a refining of those practices or a refreshing approach to them through your reading.

                        Footnotes
    1. Higher Consciousness is a term describing an expansion of human awareness into a divine awareness of what is real on every plane of existence. Also called the super consciousness (Yoga), objective consciousness (Gurdjieff), Buddhic consciousness (Theosophy), cosmic consciousness, God-consciousness (Sufism and
        Hinduism) and Christ consciousness (
        New Thought).
    2. ‚ÄúSolar Presence‚Äù is a new term, introduced by the ascended masters through The Hearts Center dispensation, to describe that part of our being that is God, depicted as the upper figure in ‚Äú


                Your Buddha Nature Chart
            .‚Äù The Solar Presence is also called the I AM Presence, the Divine Presence, the God Presence. It is the individualization of the One, our true divine identity. In the wording ‚ÄúSolar Presence‚Äù we see the image of our total being as a radiating sun center which continually emanates divine love and every virtue to all life.
    3. Decrees are poetic prayers that affirm the work of God in us and invoke more of God as light energy into our beings. Their rhyming pattern facilitates memorization and repetition. And repetition intensifies this light energy within our chakras producing positive change in us and in the world. Decrees are much like the mantras of the East, and their action of light can be more intense than the light which is released through prayer or meditation depending on the focus, attainment and momentum of the individual offering the decree. Click ‚Äú

            Prayers and Songs‚Äù to read and hear decrees given during our services and vigils.
    4. Djwal Kul, also called ‚ÄúMaster D.K.‚Äù or ‚ÄúThe Tibetan,‚Äù is known in esoteric circles for his embodiment as a Tibetan master and also as an ascended being who assists planetary evolution. He was introduced to a wider audience through the writings of Madame Helena Blavatsky, co-founder of the Theosophical Society. Messenger of the Great White Brotherhood, Elizabeth Clare Prophet, revealed that Djwal Kul had been embodied as one of the three wisemen, Caspar. Through The Summit Lighthouse and The Hearts Center, Djwal Kul has taught the importance of the holy breath and forms of breathing that promote spiritual and physical well-being and progress.To hear the entirety of Djwal Kul‚Äôs message on union with the God within, click
