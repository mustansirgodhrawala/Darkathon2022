Buy Millionaire Stolen Bitcoin Wallets!Be rich with a paltry investment compared to the amount you will receive.Buy now!We accept Monero payments only.Trade your Monero for a wallet with alot Bitcoins!@ Who we are?People (crackers/hackers) who enjoy stealing and breaking passwords into
 someone else's wallets. We then
 offer these wallets for
 sale. The whole sale is completely anonymous. We do not store any information. Contact:
 stolenwallets@dnmx.org@ Why are wallets so cheap?1) Stolen wallets cannot be sold at full price. The maximum price can be set to 10% of
 the
 wallet balance. We can hardly sell high-volume wallets for dozens of BTCs. Therefore, the price can
 reach a
 minimum of 0.1%. The bigger the wallet, the less it costs. Attention. we only talk about stolen wallets!
 2) We need to get rid of our wallets quickly. We own them for too long and due to the
 high
 balance it is not good for us. Split wallets into smaller parts is inefficient for us. The new owner can
 do
 that.3) Due to the high price of BTC, we can afford to sell wallets so cheaply. It is
 possible
 that in the future we will raise the price to 1% if the price of BTC falls rapidly.4) The goal of selling stolen wallets is not to make money, but to get rid of them
 (change
 the owner) for at least some profit. Theft is more fun for us.@ Can I send all the amount to an exchange or another Wallet?Yes, but it is recommended that you use the Mixer or Coinjoin from Wasabi Wallet function before sending to any exchange, such as Binance, KuCoin and others.@ Why can't we use these wallets ourselves?Due to the fact that we have illegally acquired them, we run the risk of suspected theft.
 Therefore, it is better for us to simply sell them for some symbolic price. Moreover, in our country, it
 is
 extremely illegal and it is not realistic to convert such a large amount into our currency. We recommend
 the
 future owner to use a stock market or mixer or both before transferring them to their own wallet.@ Do you have telegram or qTox or any other way to direct communication?No.
 I made this site fully automated for the purchase, so you don't need to contact me directly,
 but if after payment the button "Show Password" to extract the wallet is not unlocked,
 send me your Bitcoin payment hash ID(TX ID) and the address of the wallet you purchased via email: stolenwallets@dnmx.org
 I will reply the password to extract.
 @ Do you accept Escrow?Yes.
 We currently support Escrow contracts from this service only: The Escrow
 Start an Escrow contract at: escrowsdk2kxf2lrdgviuuuxkdw6yxs3ivlenonhi3j5f5mycxtx57qd.onion
 Send us the "Invoice ID" of your contract after payment to stolenwallets@dnmx.org
 After you receive the password to extract wallet and recover it, you need to release payment to us.
 @ Can I have the wallet and then pay?Obviously not.
 You won't get anything for free, pay directly or use escrow.
 @ Do you have less expensive wallets?No.
 We don't work with low values, we only have these wallets with large amounts of Bitcoin for these prices.
