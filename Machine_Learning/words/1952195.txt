    Europe will ask green pass to another year 2022-2023-2024 and probably all the world too.

You need to be vaccinated or buy a pass from us.

The difference? Vax can give you side effects our pass no!

We offer a 5 days money back for the pass we sell, but only 5 days.

So if you claims you money back after 7 days you can’t get them!!!

Used to sell on raidforum.com but cops seized the domain
