	Cloned Credit Cards ( free shipping )



			By clonecards@dnmx.org »
			Mon May 04, 2015 2:46 am






Hi everyone ,


Im back with cloned credit cards, Every card comes with a 4 digit pin & it is safe to use everywhere in the world that accepts master card & visa. I have enough supplies to make 100+ Master/Visa Credit/Debit cards per day. The card won't ever get frozen and can be used just like a regular credit card, These cards can be used to shop in stores and you can use them to cashout in ATMs worldwide.


&

Price is $140, Guaranteed to have at least $3000 left on CC limit, most are over $3500


2 x CC = $250 (Inlcuding free express shipping)


3 x CC = $350 (Including free FedEx International Next Flight shipping)


4 x CC = $400 (Including free FedEx International Next Flight shipping)


5 x CC = $550 (Including free FedEx International Next Flight shipping)


6 x CC = $600 (Including free FedEx International Next Flight shipping)
&


For any questions and orders, Please contact me at clonecards@dnmx.org


Cheers

@hugo Yes this is available and you don't have to ask if it is real. everybody knows me and my reputation in deepweb. It is obvious that this is real. I serviced over 2k transactions. 1 card is for $300. It will cost you such little money to get big money of 4k - 5k. If you are serious send me a email: clonecards@dnmx.org

Hi cc100best , before I order, I want to know some things:


The package is mailed to any countries?
For receiving, tracking number and mobile phone number (for mail agent) is enough?
Must give the real name with the real address for shipping?
It can be used at ATM or only in stores?


Thank you



			#15. by
			clonecards@dnmx.org »
			Wed May 06, 2015 7:36 pm







Yes i ship worldwide


Just make sure you use valid name and shipping address , usually when someone tries to have things mailed to fake names or vacant houses, it might not get delivered


Yes you can use it @ any ATM


for any other question mail me at clonecards@dnmx.org

			#19. by

			Wed May 06, 2015 7:42 pm







@William I sell around 20-25 cards per day, it would be risky for me to go town to town , atm to atm every other day, cashing out cards, for security reasons its easy for me to sell cards on deep web .

Hello,


I have a question about your card services. Do your cards include a
cardholder name, billing address and CVV code? I guess I'm just a bit
confused by how they work.


Thanks!

			#59. by
			Muffins »
			Fri Aug 14, 2015 8:01 pm







Hi cc100best,


Im interested and will probably buy one card for start. Just a few
questions, You say on your site that the card will not get frozen, what do
you mean by that? They are cloned, so when I start doing any purchases
someone will spot suspicious transactions on their account within one
month or less depending on when the monthly statement is being issued. So
is it better to cashout/spent all the money as soon as possible or your
cards are somehow special and I do not need to worry about that? Sorry for
the long question.. Other thing I want to ask is would you be able to send
any specific card like EU instead US?


Thx
Muffins

It was shocking to recive the credit cards...looking so genuie...I went to the store and paid for 7 bucks with the card to see if it works,I was nervous but it worked, after that I've used it at the ATM and took 800 bucks and then another 800 for 4 days and I think there's something left still.

Hey,


Came across your onion site, was looking to buy 1 credit card with 4 digit
pin.
I was wondering if it was possible to send the card data via file and
email with pin. I have the facility to create the cards and just need the
data.
Just looking for a price etc


Cheers
Steve
