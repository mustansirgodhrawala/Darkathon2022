        GUARANTIES







       We have been working for four years. During the whole time we have 97% of successful matches.
        The information we provide isn’t a prediction, it’s a fixed match.
        The game’s result is 100% known. Of course, sometimes something might go wrong, in which case we'll give you money back or new information.





       WHY TOP FIXED MATCHES?





        LEGALITY

          Bets are officially allowed in almost all countries of the world.
          No one will know if your bet on a fixed match or just a lucky prediction.







        CHEAPNESS

          We sell fixed matches with high odds at the lowest prices in TOR.
          You can make sure in it by comparing prices with other services.







        RELIABILITY

          We are one of the
          few services with fixed matches that managed to
           stay in TOR and continue to develop until now.






        HOW IT WORKS?

       To make it easier to understand how our site works, we will give you an example.
       You buy a match info for 100$ with an odd of 12.
       Next, you place a bet for 50$ and after winning the match you'll get 600$.
       Total you earn 450$ in two hours is absolutely legally.
