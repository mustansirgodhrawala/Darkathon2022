Why should I use this wallet instead of a clearnet wallet?
Your transactions on our site are not trackable, while clearnet wallets are trackable. We will mix the ethereum for you, for no fee.


Is there a smartphone app or something?
Not yet, but you can simply pay using our site.


How does it work?
Simply create a free account. After that, you will get a new ethereum adress. To pay securely, you need to send ethereums to that address, after you have a positive balance, you can use these ethereums to pay on other darknet services securely (CP, Drugs, Guns).


What happens if I lose my password?
Don't lose your password! We don't have password recovery functions for security reasons. (Accounts are much more likely to be compromised if there is an account password recovery function)
We recommend you write down your password and username on a piece of paper and store it in a safe place.


Can I get a new ethereum address?
To keep it simple we only support one address per account, but if you need more, you can always open more accounts.


Are there any fees on Ethereum Wallet?
We don't charge any fees except for the transaction fees on the ethereum network.
