                  About



















































































































































































































































































          Our company





























































  Twitter is an open service that’s home to a world of diverse people, perspectives, ideas, and information.








































































































































































































































































































































































  OUR PURPOSE


























          We serve the public conversation.




























  It matters to us that people have a free and safe space to talk. That’s why we’re constantly improving our rules and processes, technology and tools. 

We’re not perfect — that’s why we listen to you, the people on Twitter. It’s also why we work to be as transparent as possible.
























  Having a global impact
In 2021, we published our first Global Impact Report. We're committed to sharing the work we know is important to the people we serve.

  OUR PRINCIPLES


























          We live by the following principles:



















































































  Promoting health
Freedom of speech is a fundamental human right — but freedom to have that speech amplified by Twitter is not. Our rules exist to promote healthy conversations.


















































  Earning people’s trust
Twitter is what’s happening. To stay reliable and credible, we must always be earning your trust. 











































































































  Making it straightforward
Simple is good, but straightforward is better. Our product, our behavior, and our work habits should all be transparent and to the point.


















































  Uniting profit and purpose
Twitter is a purpose-driven company that does good. Visit Twitter for Good to find out more about how we tie philanthropy to our business objectives.











































































































  Being fast, free, and fun
We should move fast, feel free to be ourselves, and have fun. That’s Twitter.



















































































































































































  OUR TEAM


























          We’re a global team.




























  We believe in working from anywhere, because it’s all about giving people choice. And a flexible workforce is foundational to building a team that is both diverse and inclusive.



























    Work with us
































































































































































































          Our leadership




























  Our board and leadership team, guided by Twitter’s principles, are shaping our next era of growth and social responsibility. They represent our team, our culture, and our purpose.
