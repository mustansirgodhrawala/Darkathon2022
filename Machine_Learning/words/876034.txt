Trentham Falls is one of the longest single drop vertical waterfall. The drop plunges around 32 metres over basalt column smashing into the chasm below. The energy from the fall is breathtaking. Behind the waterfall is a shallow cave which adds some character to the beautiful scenery.        Trentham Falls, Trentham Album — Other Photos
