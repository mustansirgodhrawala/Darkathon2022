		When you switch on a VPN, it sends your web traffic through an encrypted tunnel to a server controlled by the VPN company. From there, it exits onto the web as normal. If you make sure to only connect to websites secured with HTTPS, your data will continue to be encrypted even after it leaves the VPN. This sounds simple, and maybe superfluous, but it can have profound effects on your privacy.
1. NordVPN
NordVPN has long been regarded as one of the strongest brands in cybersecurity. With one of the largest server offerings on my list and support for most, if not all operating systems, making NordVPN an obvious choice for many. They have 24/7 customer support if you need help getting started. Their app is one of the most well-designed apps I have ever used. NordVPN even accepts cryptocurrencies as payment for extra anonymity.Link:https://nordvpn.com
2. PrivateVPN
PrivateVPN is the strong underdog in the world of VPNs. With a shy number of servers, it is evident that they are focusing on quality over quantity. Overall, PrivateVPN is a very decent choice of VPN, especially if you had enough of the excessive advertising by some of the other more known brands in this list. Setting up the VPN requires extremely little intervention, and you can even pay with Bitcoin.Link:https://privatevpn.com/
3. PrivateInternetAccess
Is at the top of my streaming tests, which is a great combination with their easy-to-use UI, Open-Source software and built in adblocker. PIA is also perfect for those who want to be able to pay with PayPal which for some reason, many other VPN services do not support. 30-day money-back guarantee, multiple Netflix libraries, and extremely affordable are the three main selling points for this VPN service.Link:https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/
4. CyberGhost VPN
Is the first choice of many other cybersecurity experts, and the reason is clear; they have the most complete VPN service. An incredible number of extra features that are best suited for the more advanced users but also work flawlessly for every-day purposes like P2P-filesharing. Cyberghost VPN also has the longest stretching money-back guarantee at a full 45 days.Link:https://www.cyberghostvpn.com/en_US/
5. Surfshark VPN
Is perfect for those who want a cheap and reliable VPN that also has many extra features. "Camouflage Mode" hides your usage from your ISP, "Kill Switch" suspends your connection and protects your information if you temporarily lose Internet access, "MultiHop" to connect from multiple countries at the same time just to name a few. My favorite feature of Surfshark is "Whitelists" which allow the user to exclude specific apps and programs from the VPN connection.Link:https://surfshark.com/deals
6. Hola VPN
garnered a bad reputation a few years back when it's free proxy service was abused, and some user data was leaked. Hola quickly fixed the issues, but the damage to Hola's reputation was already made. Today, Hola VPN is a strong contender in the search of the best vpn service. Hola has industry standard encryption, thousands of high-speed servers, and, a solid no log policy. The price is also very affordable, especially considering you can connect 10 devices simultaneously.Link:https://hola.org/
7. ProtonVPN
Is based in Switzerland and is most known for their e-mail service ProtonMail. They currently offer the safest free VPN services on the market. There is also support for TOR usage and P2P file sharing. I highly recommend ProtonVPN if you are intending to do some extensive online sharing. It goes without saying that Proton does not collect logs of any kind and is completely safe to use.Link:https://protonvpn.com/
8. Privacy International
Privacy International (PI) is a UK-based registered charity that defends and promotes privacy around the world. First created in 1990, authorized as a nonprofit company in 2002, so that as a charity in 2012, PI is sitting in London. Its current professional director, since 2012, is Dr. Gus Hosein.Link:https://privacyintyqcroe.onion/
9. OVPN
Is the best alternative for people who expect heavy security from their VPN provider. No other operator has the same level of physical security that OVPN has. All their servers operate without any type of storing media, which would otherwise log information. One selling point that really stands out, is their insurance. They go out of their way to protect their customers by having insurance so that when some government requests documents, they will have the resources needed to fight the claim in court.

10. HotSpot Shield
Protect your personal information from hackers, snoopers, and ISPs with the fastest free VPN of 2021. That is right, the crown for fastest free VPN has already been claimed by Hotspot Shield, supported by multiple speed tests around the web, including my own. While their premium VPN service is one of the more expensive ones, the free version is good enough for people who just cannot pay for a VPN service, but still value their online privacy.Link:https://www.gohotspotshield.com/
11. Trust.Zone


Is a rather new player in the VPN-game that offers a minimalistic VPN-option for a competitive price. Based in Seychelles with no-logging policies, this is a great alternative for those that want to remain completely anonymous. Unlimited speed and bandwidth make this a decent choice of VPN for P2P-sharing. All common operative systems are supported.
