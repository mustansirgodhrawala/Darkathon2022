Killer cooling technology


Game faster and for longer periods of time thanks to Element 31*, an industry-first and Alienware-exclusive encapsulated gallium-silicone thermal interface material. Offering a 25% improvement in thermal resistance*, Element 31 works more efficiently than previous solutions pulling heat away from the CPU with double the energy storage capability over the previous generation*. Element 31 will slow down in double the time that it would normally take the CPU temperatures to increase by 45oC*.Indirectly, total system temperatures will benefit from this environment as well.

Four is better than one: Introducing Alienware's quad fan technology, a patent-pending industry exclusive included in our X-Series laptops. This new design includes a combination of standard evacuative fans which move air through the system as well as, patented, dual opposite outlet (DOO) fan which move air through the chassis and over various internal hotspots creating a pressurized environment that dissipates heat and reduces external temperatures. Each fan is intelligently controlled and uniquely programmed to function individually to meet the desired equilibrium of cooling. This helps your system maintain optimized airflow and internal chassis pressure for better performance.

Intelligent quad airflow: Game with confidence and rest assured that your system is being intelligently cooled according to your type of gameplay and its thermal requirements. Each of the four fans independently functions to regulate and control system surface temperatures, CPU and GPU. Plus, each fan can independently spin-up, slow down, or remain steady according to your system's needs, prioritizing movement of the fans that are positioned to enable the best benefit for your system.


Thermal Control Circuit Offset:yes

Total control
The Thermal Control Circuit Offset is a feature that can be set within the BIOS if you choose to set a “cruise control” limit to your CPU temperature. This gives you the power and peace of mind to manage your CPU temperature within a safe limit you deem comfortable for everyday use. If you don’t like to tinker with your system, then you can game with the default setting set by Intel.

Killer cooling technology


Game faster and for longer periods of time thanks to Element 31*, an industry-first and Alienware-exclusive encapsulated gallium-silicone thermal interface material. Offering a 25% improvement in thermal resistance*, Element 31 works more efficiently than previous solutions pulling heat away from the CPU with double the energy storage capability over the previous generation*. Element 31 will slow down in double the time that it would normally take the CPU temperatures to increase by 45oC*.Indirectly, total system temperatures will benefit from this environment as well.

Four is better than one: Introducing Alienware's quad fan technology, a patent-pending industry exclusive included in our X-Series laptops. This new design includes a combination of standard evacuative fans which move air through the system as well as, patented, dual opposite outlet (DOO) fan which move air through the chassis and over various internal hotspots creating a pressurized environment that dissipates heat and reduces external temperatures. Each fan is intelligently controlled and uniquely programmed to function individually to meet the desired equilibrium of cooling. This helps your system maintain optimized airflow and internal chassis pressure for better performance.

Intelligent quad airflow: Game with confidence and rest assured that your system is being intelligently cooled according to your type of gameplay and its thermal requirements. Each of the four fans independently functions to regulate and control system surface temperatures, CPU and GPU. Plus, each fan can independently spin-up, slow down, or remain steady according to your system's needs, prioritizing movement of the fans that are positioned to enable the best benefit for your system.

Killer cooling technology


Game faster and for longer periods of time thanks to Element 31*, an industry-first and Alienware-exclusive encapsulated gallium-silicone thermal interface material. Offering a 25% improvement in thermal resistance*, Element 31 works more efficiently than previous solutions pulling heat away from the CPU with double the energy storage capability over the previous generation*. Element 31 will slow down in double the time that it would normally take the CPU temperatures to increase by 45oC*.Indirectly, total system temperatures will benefit from this environment as well.

Four is better than one: Introducing Alienware's quad fan technology, a patent-pending industry exclusive included in our X-Series laptops. This new design includes a combination of standard evacuative fans which move air through the system as well as, patented, dual opposite outlet (DOO) fan which move air through the chassis and over various internal hotspots creating a pressurized environment that dissipates heat and reduces external temperatures. Each fan is intelligently controlled and uniquely programmed to function individually to meet the desired equilibrium of cooling. This helps your system maintain optimized airflow and internal chassis pressure for better performance.

Intelligent quad airflow: Game with confidence and rest assured that your system is being intelligently cooled according to your type of gameplay and its thermal requirements. Each of the four fans independently functions to regulate and control system surface temperatures, CPU and GPU. Plus, each fan can independently spin-up, slow down, or remain steady according to your system's needs, prioritizing movement of the fans that are positioned to enable the best benefit for your system.


Thermal Control Circuit Offset:yes

Total control
The Thermal Control Circuit Offset is a feature that can be set within the BIOS if you choose to set a “cruise control” limit to your CPU temperature. This gives you the power and peace of mind to manage your CPU temperature within a safe limit you deem comfortable for everyday use. If you don’t like to tinker with your system, then you can game with the default setting set by Intel.
