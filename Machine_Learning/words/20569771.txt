					About Ethereum Generator


					Ethereum is a decentralized cryptocurrency, currently #2 in
popularity (down to Bitcoin). This decentralization made Ethereum
open-coded and everyone can mine it. Through time regular mining became
expensive. Ethereum emerges in 2013, almost "as silent as the grave".
However, it increased its popularity in 2017, and it is considered that
it will continue to do so. Therefore, the necessity for Ethereum
Generator emerged. It's a process of mining Ethereum, but using a
web-application. Generateethereum.com is the only licensed platform that
 allows the mining generation procedure of Ethereum.



					Now when a method to generate Ethereum with no additional costs has
 been invented, we are proud to present how our web application works.
It's a Kernel web-based algorithm that intercepts hard mathematical
problems. These problems are generated with every Ethereum transaction
worldwide. It's our system's job to find it, solve it and mine Ethereum
for you, into your wallet address, for free. The process lasts for a
minute, and it counts as a regular transaction.
