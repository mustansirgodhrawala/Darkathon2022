    hello im camilla from belgium i just scammed by someone today Inspired by Cards Against Humanity's Black Friday experience where users can buy nothing for $5, comes this web idea where, if you put a bitcoin address in the wild and ask people to give you bitcoin in exchange for absolutely nothing, will it work?


       I could go on and say that every Bitcoin sent to me will make the world a better place that as an aspiring web developer living in the Philippines, this could potentially be life-changing money. But how could I compete against the impeccably written and well thought out GoFundMe's and Kickstarters?  Ultimately, the choice is up to you.  Pls Give Me Bitcoins.
