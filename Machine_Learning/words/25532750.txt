		I used to drink a lot of hard liquor and at one point my doctor had prescribed adderall for my ADHD. If alcohol mixed with coke is anything like alcohol mixed with adderall/amphetamines then all I can say is Holy shit.

While on adderall I had been able to drink more than enough to put me down but to remain fully alert, balanced and focused on whatever I was doing. I realized I had a big problem one day when I had drank mostly whiskey but also rum, tequila and vodka over the course of sixteen hours and would routinely put away two pints of liquor in a night.

I‚Äôve been sober for 16 months now. The ADHD meds tho are going to be the death of me. I can‚Äôt seem to function without them anymore. I quit once for a year and once for six months but I struggled to function, watched the color fade out of my life, being either unable or unwilling to do the things in life that I enjoy and constantly having an energy deficiency where I sometimes felt like I could barely stand. I‚Äôve been back on Vyvanse for a few months now and really hate the feeling that I can‚Äôt pull myself through life without it being my motor but being on it isn‚Äôt as depressing as being off of it and I definitely don‚Äôt want to go out of this place like HST.

		When you're a regular user you learn to force yourself to eat and sleep whether you want to or not. Also with that much alcohol he has to.eat something or he'll die.

Stuff was one hell of a mix after sleep deprivation diluted the effects of the individual chemicals.

		That's how you know this routine is mostly bs. No way you could drop acid more than couple times a month. More than once a week, It wouldn't give you any significant effect to be worth taking

		Yeah exactly I could imagine him doing this occasionally but this doesn‚Äôt seem like it really makes sense as a daily routine, not least because of how massively exhausting and unhealthy it is

		That‚Äôs what makes this hard to believe . Eating while on acid? I don‚Äôt care how use to it your body is, he probably has done all of this in a day before but it‚Äôs hard to believe this was a ‚Äúroutine‚Äù. Maybe a bit of sensationalism?

		The acid might not have been incredibly strong.

Also, if you listen to this guys interviews towards the end of his life, there has clearly been some effect.

		I have a new life goal, to party all night and conclude with some champagne and fettuccine Alfredo, in a hot tub, as the sun rises.

Alfredo in the hot tub is a recipe for disaster, but it would be a risk worth taking.

		I can give you a little writer's input if you like. When you're doing lots of drugs and drinking everyday, it becomes a part of your routine, just like writing is a part of your routine. At some point, these two routines become so interlinked that doing one without the other seems hopeless, like something is off. The magic doesn't come unless everything is just so and HST's addictions created this drug threshold for writing magic - not intentionally but because he was addicted. Had he ever cleaned up and kicked his addictions, he still would have been a very fine writer. But it was all in his head that the two were forever linked.

		yep, folks have this romantic notion that artists have to be troubled. Just not true. This is nothing more than Pavlovian conditioning with extremely destructive elements. People can do drugs responsibly to elevate life‚Äôs experiences ; but yikes, it‚Äôs clear to all that his deep substance abuse problems were the primary driver of his depression and failing health.

		Thats a pretty common diet for a hugh functioning cocaine user. I worked in finance and there were plenty of people who operated that way. The alcohol would be after work only though. The alcohol takes the edge off the cocaine you see.

This will produce a heart attack anywhere from immediately to in a few years btw.
