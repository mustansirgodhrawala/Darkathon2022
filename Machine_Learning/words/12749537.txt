@Davis, dont transfer all funds in one go, transfer 30% first then rest of the funds in 2nd transfer.

Tried to send an email earlier, you may get a duplicate.


I am interested in both your services, especially the paypal to bitcoin
service. How long does that take from ordering to execution?
I would like this 3) 1490 USD with cc attached - 0.57 BTC
so I guess 0.62 with bitcoin execution?


Look forward for your reply.


Also interested in 5 cards delivered to Portugal.

Just posting a review of my first experience.
I just finished up with my first account, purchased yesterday morning. The tutorial is very well written, and the method works 100%. All of my transactions went through without a hitch. It took 2 hours from purchase to me having cash in my hands AMAZING!, it tool little longer  ,they claim 30 minutes, anyways
Thank you cc100best I look forward to lots of future business with you. You are performing a wonderful service here!

Good job, at least someone is providing a quality service. I've been away for a while and saw majority of the PP seller vendors have gone idle. Maybe its due to pizza being away. Anyways, I'm just speculating. Don't minde me haha.

Hi,


Please do you have any paypal account selling in the range of 0.11BTC and
how much is in the account and how much is it worth in BTC.


Also, I will like to know how long it takes to transfer the BTC to my
wallet upon receiving payment.


Lastly, do I need to pay extra money for the cashout from PP to BTC or
will it be included in the cost?


Please reply me as soon as possible as I am considering placing an order
right away if your offer is better than what I already have.


PS: I want to start with this small amount first as this will be my first
transaction with you and if it goes pretty well and your rates are very
competitive, then we are in business together.


Thank you.
