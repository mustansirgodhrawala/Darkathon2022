			Hello, for the past week or so I've been using the cryptofree service. Up until just a few hours ago it had been working great. But for some reason the speeds I've been getting torrenting have plummeted from about 100/80 to 15/30 bytes (yes, bytes) in/out. Somwhere I've seen said cryptofree is limited to around 160kbps in and 130kbps out. Is this in bytes or bits? If it is bits as the capitalization suggests then is it weird I've been getting higher speeds? I have tried with another vpn and I've been getting 400/100 on average easy.

			@OP

If I remember rightly, Cryptofree is limited to 1Mb/s download speed (can't remember what the upload is).

Any idea why my speeds dropped so much then? I can't re-test right now to see if it's sorted itself out, but I'll do that later today.

Just if I wasn't clear enough; I was getting about 15KB/s in, when I should (assuming 1mb/s cap) be getting more like 125KB/s.

			@OP

I've just done a speed test using Cryptofree to grab a test file on CacheFly's CDN. I'm getting around 40-45KB/s (320-360Kbit/s).  This is on an 8Mb/1Mb ADSL connection.

Could it be that Cryptofree is choking, or maybe mis-configured?

			Really sorry for the late reply. I've got an account now. By choking I assume you mean being limited by my bandwidth speed. If so then it's possible, but unlikely (using wifi with decent speed, just significant distance from modem). I've done some more tests and I really have no idea what's going on. I connect, test out torrenting get up to about 60/30 KB/s in/out, then I disconnect and reconnect again and it doesn't get past 20/15 KB/s in/out. Maybe I'm not leaving it long enough? I don't know. I'm using the Windows widget, what settings would you recommend?

Also, some unlikely things that might be messing it up could possibly be my client (Tixati), which does display some weird behavior occasionally even with the other VPNs I've tested... Or it could possibly be something to do with port forwarding, as it was just around the time when I first tried enabling it that stuff went weird. I'll probably test again with qBittorrent soon. Thanks for your time.

			@bentbanana223

Just out of interest, why are you torrenting over Cryptofree?  Cryptofree is really a taster service and is useful for low bandwidth services such as IRC, instant messaging and email (depending on email content, obviously).

It also serves as a backup if your token has just run out; tokens are dirt cheap so again, why torrent over Cryptofree?

			I'm using it to test speeds, and since I torrent a fair bit I'm wondering why it's only getting really poor speeds at times, and if that would carry on with an actual token.

Also I have tested with qBittorent and the speeds were the same.

Torrents (well seeded ones) download as fast as the processor on my router allows. They aren't throttled or anything.

A good test is to download a copy of Linux Mint via BitTorrent from here.

Now that was satisfying, you're not wrong!

Consistently over 4MB/s (4.25 peak) on a Asus AC68U (over clocked to 1200 MHz) on a 40Mbit connection. I don't see that often!

			@blurb

Is the VPN connection on your router or your desktop?  If it's on your router, that's pretty bloody impressive!

			@parityboy

That's the router  (laptop connected via ethernet). Over-clocked as mentioned, and running Tomato (Kille72 fork).

It's been running over clocked for a few years now without issue. When the kids are here it's continuously pushed as hard as it will go and is steady as a rock.

			@blurb

That sounds good.

Is your connection cable, fiber or xDSL (including hybrid fiber)?  Also, would you be kind enough to document your experience in the Speed Test thread?
