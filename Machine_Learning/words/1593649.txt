					SunshinePipeline - Xanax

						Hey fellow drug enthusiasts, or as the general public would call us - Criminals, animals, drug addicts and so on. All the while they will happily finish off a bottle of spirits and speak about it like a badge of honour (I have nothing against alcohol by the way I just always find this hilariously ironic)  Anyway, I am keen to order some of SunshinePipeline Xanax 2mg bars. Has anyone tried any of this vendors Xanax and do you know whether it is legit Alprazolam or pressed Flualp or some other RC benzo?Cheers!

						It'll be Flubrotizolam or Flunitrazolam, maybe Bromazolam. The classic bars everyone knows as Xanax aren't actually made anymore by pharmaceutical companies, so literally every single bar you've ever bought has been home pressed. It's almost 100% certain to be an RC if you bought it since about 2010. UGLs aren't pumping out Alprazolam powder anymore despite what that "raw powders" scam site promised you. There was a time they were, but those Chinese labs are now 100% switched to producing legal RCs instead. Generic Alprazolam from India is legit, but it is just normal pills not bars. Though there are just as many fake Indian pharmaceutical companies as legit ones. For example Deus Medical is 100% an Underground Lab that brew and press steroids and SARMs themselves and put it in legit looking packaging. So there is a good chance even your legit seeming Indian Alprazolam that is in packaging and everything is really just Flubrotizolam. Also FYI Alprazolam isn't prescribed in NZ, even the generic version, so it is even more unlikely that real Alprazolam is available here. The more you know.

						Selling Trenbolone in any form pretty much dispels any myth about Deus being a legitimate pharmaceutical company. The last time there was pharmaceutical Tren made was in the 90s. Not saying it isn't good gear.

						If one goes on aliexpress they can buy really great looking packaging with holograms and fake QR codes, lot numbers, serial numbers etc.
