        This website is an online archive and it's outdated!


        Some resources you will find here are outdated. We are currently working on a new developer portal.
        You can find updated and maintained resources about Tor Browser Manual, User Support, Relay Operations and Onion Services. If you have any questions or need help, please contact us.








    Getting up to speed on Tor's past,
    present, and future


    First, read the overview page to get a
    basic idea of how Tor works, what it's for, and who uses it.


    Install Tor Browser and try it out.
    Be sure to read the
    list of warnings about ways you
    can screw up your anonymity. Look through the Tor
    Browser Design Document.


    Our FAQ
    covers all sorts of topics, including questions about setting up a client
    or relay, concerns about anonymity attacks, why we didn't build Tor in
    other ways, etc.
    There's a separate Abuse FAQ to answer
    common questions from or for relay operators.
    The Tor Legal FAQ is written by
    EFF lawyers, and aims to give you an overview of some of the legal issues
    that arise from The Tor Project in the US.

    Check out the Tor
    Stack Exchange Q&A Site, and help us make the questions and
    answers better.
    The manual
    lists all the possible entries you can put in your torrc
    file. We also provide a manual for
    the development version of Tor.
    If you have questions, we have an IRC channel at
    #tor on irc.oftc.net (you can
    join via Tor as well). Developers work
    in #tor-dev and relay operators
    help each other in #tor-relays,
    read this fine article by

    Tor's Relay Advocate. If you have a bug, especially a crash bug, read
    how to report a Tor bug
    first and then tell us as much information about it as you can in
    our bugtracker.
    (If your bug is
    with your browser or some other application, please don't put
    it in our bugtracker.) The
    tor-talk mailing list can also be useful.


    Tor has a blog.
    We try to keep it updated every week or two with the latest news.


    Download and watch Roger's Tor
    overview talk from Internet Days in Sweden (video,
    slides,
    youtube),
    which provides good background on how Tor works and what it's for.


    Learn about our censorship circumvention side: watch our 28C3
    talk in December 2011 on how governments have tried to block Tor (video,
    youtube, slides),
    an overview
    of what to look for in a circumvention tool,
    and the original "blocking-resistance and
    circumvention" talk from 23C3 in December 2006 (video,
    slides, abstract,
    design
    paper).

    Learn about the wide diversity of projects in
    the Tor ecosystem that need your help. Watch the 29c3
    video on the Tor software ecosystem to learn more.


    Look through Tor's Design
    Documents. Notice that we have RFC-style specs to tell you exactly
    how Tor is built.
    Learn about the Tor
    proposal process for changing our design, and look over the existing proposals.


    Our sponsor TODO list starts with a
    timeline for external promises — things our
    sponsors have paid to see done. It also lists many other tasks
    and topics we'd like to tackle next.


    Once you're up to speed, things will continue to change surprisingly fast.
    The tor-dev mailing list is where the complex
    discussion happens, and the #tor and #tor-dev IRC channels
    are where the rest of the discussion happens.



    Mailing List Information
    Tor runs many
    mailing lists. New users will be most interested in:

    tor-announce
    is a low volume list for announcements of new releases and critical
    security updates. Everybody should be on this list. There is also
    an RSS
    feed.
    tor-talk
    is where a lot of discussion happens, and is where we send
    notifications of prerelease versions and release candidates.
    tor-relays
    list is for discussions about running, configuring, and handling
    your tor relay or bridge. If you currently run a relay or bridge,
    or are thinking about doing so, this is the list for you.
    tor-onions
    is like tor-relays but for onion
    services.
    tor-dev
    is for posting by developers only, and is very low traffic.


    Design Documents

    The design document (published at Usenix Security 2004)
    gives our justifications and security analysis for the Tor design:
    PDF and
    HTML
    versions available.
    Thirteen key design changes since the original 2004 paper:
    part one,
    part two,
    part three.

    Our preliminary design to make it harder for large firewalls to
    prevent access to the Tor network is described in
    design of a blocking-resistant anonymity system:
    PDF draft and
    HTML draft.
    Want to help us build it?
    The specifications aim to give
    developers enough information to build a compatible version of Tor:

    Main Tor specification
    Tor
    version 3 directory server specification (and older version 2 directory
    specification)
    Tor control protocol
    specification
    Tor rendezvous specification: version 2 and version 3
    Tor path selection
    specification
    Special hostnames in
    Tor
    Tor's SOCKS support
    and extensions
    How Tor version numbers
    work
    In-progress drafts of
    new specifications and proposed changes

    wiki provides a plethora of helpful contributions from Tor
    users. Check it out!

    list of supporting programs you might want to use in association with
    Tor.

    Tor detector tries to guess if you're using Tor or not.
    Check out Tor network status information using Relay Search.
    Remember that these lists may not be as accurate as what your Tor
    client uses, because your client fetches its own directory information and
    examines it locally.

    papers (especially the ones in boxes) to get up to speed on the field
    of anonymous communication systems.
