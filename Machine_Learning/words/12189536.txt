			I'm currently looking for a VPN provider that has good support for torrents (so must have port forwarding.)
The thing is though, I don't understand most of the technical details so I don't know what's right for me.
My use case is to torrent through apps like qBittorent, Soulseek, emule etc.
Will CS fully support them apps with a good connection? Once I buy an account on CS, do I only have to go to the port forward config site and put in the port I need, then nothing else?

And one more thing, emule uses port 4664 (I think), but if I understand things right CS only lets you use port forwarding for ports above 30000 - does that mean I can't use emule, or more precisely, does that mean emule wont get port forwarded? Will it be stuck as "Yellow"? I really want to have a "Green" connection so I can contribute and give back to the network.

Thank you and I hope my questions were clear enough to understand

			@OP

OK, I'll try to address your questions step by step.

1. BitTorrent
I can attest to BitTorrent working perfectly with both private and public trackers. I use port forwarding with CS and it works as expected and yes, once connected you simply go to the port forwarding config site and enter the port number you want; if it hasn't already been taken by someone else, it will be assigned to you.

2. eMule
Same principle as BitTorrent however, CS only supports one forwarded port per user VPN connection. In other words, if you have BitTorrent and eMule running on the same machine, only one of those apps will be able to use port forwarding.  Of course there are ways around this (second machine, virtual machine etc.) but be aware of this limitation.

As for the eMule port itself, can it not be changed in the client?

			I see, I was worried that port forwarding needed some advanced configuration on your router or something like that, I'm glad it's this easy. After checking, eMule does allow you to change the port it uses and has no issues with that, it also lets you use a single port if you configure it that way. The client I'm using, aMule, doesn't let you change all the port settings in the GUI, but it works when you edit the config file.

Thank you for answering, just wanted to make sure I understood everything before actually doing it
