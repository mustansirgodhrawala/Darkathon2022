                        Frequently asked Questions
                        Here are a few frequently asked questions with the answers


                        Why are your prizes so high?

                            I have nothing to give away, I want to
make a profit. You are sure to find cheaper providers, but in my
experience, almost everything is scam. So buy something expensive, but
safe.

                        Can you still negotiate the price?

                            No, please don't ask for it any more.

                        What happens after I pay?

                            When you have paid and my payment gateway
 has registered it, an email will be sent to the email address entered.
The email has an attachment with the wallet file. Please make sure with
your order that the email address is entered correctly.
