https://activitypub.rocks/
ActivityPub works with inboxes and outboxes. an actor sends a post to their outbox, and an actor that is subscribed to that actor's outbox will recieve their messages in their inbox. boards in fchan are actors, and they subscribe to other board's outboxes. this is basically it, pleroma and peertube use the same mechanism for their posts, and every interaction (including likes and comments) is sent as an activity to the reciever's inbox and the sender's outbox.

Yep to go off of some of the replies you got everyone has an outbox and an inbox - so on pleroma and mastodon every "actor" has an outbox and an inbox that posts go to. Fchan has no "users" so the board itself has the outbox which can be viewed for the different boards just change the instance url and board letter to peak through: https://penchan.xyz/g/outbox

Further reading
The proposed spec for Fchannel: https://github.com/FChannel0/FChannel-Server/issues/9

The actual activitypub spec: https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/

Someone already linked it but https://activitypub.rocks/ is a great starter resource

nigga nintendo requires devs to port their shit to their platform. being linux based makes this irrelevant for steamdeck, especially with proton. valve doesn't have the same barrier to entry that the switch had, but it does have the obstacle that "its just another switch"

>platform problems
the fact that every pc game that runs with proton will run on the steamdeck nullifies this. the steamdeck will a quadrillion more games than nintendo has and will already work with steam accounts, so people that have steam will have no problem buying this. remember that most nintendo redditors also probably have a pc and a steam account.

Yeah I use void and I have a problem with the packaging. Its totally controlled by the devs and that means its aggressively biased.

    how to compress data for storage?
     Anonymous

     07/11/21(Sun)16:31:59 No. fg-EOUHBZUC  [Report]
    what is the best compression algorithm to compress a shitton of data to the smallest size possible without regard for compression/decompression speed?
i have a stash of random junk that i dont feel like rummaging through any time in the near future but that is taking too much space
i looked around and xz seems to be the one, but maybe there is something better?

yea sure, its a plan9 thing. you can get those from plan9port. also take a look at 9front.
essentially what cwfs is a worm+cache filesystem, and venti just splits up the data into sets and removes duplicate sets, rather than just doing file de-duping. it also appends new data to files rather than overwriting them when they're changed, so you can easily go back to a previous version of any file using something like yesterday(1). venti also lets you just back it up into the archive easily. its pretty good
