        3 STEPS TO DO:
        1. Choose a wallet from "Bitcoin wallets" section.

        2. Send to me a BTC address what you want to buy an you will receive a BTC address to make a payment.

        3. After that you can download your wallet with password and private keys!




        Wallets for sell
        Here you can find a wallets available for buy. You should see a wallet adress, Amount inside of this wallet and price for wallet.
        ONLY HIGH AMOUNTS, IF YOU DON'T HAVE A MONEY TO PAY FOR ONE OF THIS, THEN COME BACK LATER

        Send to me what wallet address you want to buy. Contact me with:
         Wallet address what you want to buy
         When you will make a payment
         How do you want to receive a wallet.dat file with password and private keys

         After that you will receive your private BTC adress to make a payment for wallet!
         REMEMBER - After you buy one of these wallet, you will get a new big wallets list with wallets from 2 BTC to 10 BTC in one wallet and a new mailbox to contact with me. You can't buy next wallet with BTC from previous one directly. You have to launder coins from it properly and exchange them to FIAT currency. Watch out how you spent money from wallets! If you will spent too much in short amount of time and starts buy luxury cars, then some goverment institutions will want to know from where you have that money. Stay calm.
