AIRBNB 2021 CARDING METHOD:

Carding Airbnb is easy, but we donâ€™t like the fact that the company doesnâ€™t allow users to transfer the gift cards used for booking free accommodation to other Airbnb accounts, so itâ€™s a bit of a pain. , but hey thatâ€™s what it is, carders might not make a choice, okay.
The main difference between Airbnb carding and carding such asÂ Â AmazonÂ Â ,Â NikeÂ ,Â Apple Pay,Â Â Â Venmo, Wish Carding, etc.Â is that no shipping is required.
However, some carding methods suchÂ as CashAppÂ Â andÂ Â PayPalÂ Â carding alsoÂ do not use delivery.
Airbnb carding is based on an Airbnb gift card that you buy with CC (buy cc in our shopÂ hereÂ ).
You donâ€™t need multiple accounts, but you do need a VPN (optional if you want to remain anonymous) when purchasing the gift card for carding.

# CONTEXT OF AIRBNB CARDING

Airbnb was introduced in 2008 as an online reservation solution for major hotels in the United States.Â The company slowly expanded its reservation services around the world until carders around the world noticed their presence.
The first Airbnb carding was done by a Russian and he spent 5 years from 2009 to 2014 enjoying free tourism and sleeping for free in the best hotels.
The reason he might have gotten away with Airbnb carding is that you donâ€™t have to link your bank account after purchasing the gift card with CC.
In 2019 alone, Airbnb reportedly recorded $ 4.7 billion, with carders contributing more than $ 90 million to the companyâ€™s revenue.
The good news is that Airbnb has no plans to do anything about the ongoing carding because it greatly benefits the company and it is also difficult to trace the perpetrators of the act.

There is an option to purchase Airbnb gift cards from online retail stores and you can still use your CC in those stores to get Airbnb gift cards for free hotel vacations.
In the meantime, although you can do without a VPN, it is recommended that you ensure excellent security of operations.
The reason we recommend you card Airbnb on other vacation booking sites is that your gift card with carding will never expire unless you close the Airbnb account.

# Requirements for AirBNB 2021 carding

Without the right tools, you canâ€™t successfully card an Airbnb gift card.Â Fortunately, Iâ€™ve included the requirements in this Airbnb carding tutorial.
Check out the requirements for getting Airbnb carding below:

1. VPN and SOCKS5Â 

A VPN is a tool that you cannot do without as a carder.Â Typically, a premium VPN is what you need.
However, note that the VPN will ONLY protect you, it wonâ€™t be useful for carding, and this is where SOCKS5 comes in handy.
For example, if you are carding the United States, your VPN must support the United States servers and on top of that, you will use SOCKS5 to match the location near the cardholderâ€™s address.
AvailableÂ :Â Â here

2. CREDIT / DEBIT CARD

Buying a fullz CC live is the most difficult aspect of carding.Â Honestly you will find the best CC fullz you can find here in our store.
Note that the CC must match the location you want to card.
For example, if you want to card the US version of Airbnb, you need a CC registered in the US.
The reason is that the Airbnb payment portal may refuse CC payments from different countries (but not always the case).
AvailableÂ :Â Â here

3. AIRBNB ACCOUNT

Carding Airbnb should require two accounts, but thatâ€™s sort of unnecessary.
I used one account to purchase the Airbnb gift card and the same account to book luxury hotels.
But you can create two accounts;Â one account to purchase the gift card and the second account to store the gift card.
I would recommend creating two accounts as most carders use two accounts to card Airbnb.

4. BURNER PHONE NUMBER

You can get a burner phone number, also known as a temporary phone number.

5. TWO EMAIL ADDRESSES

If you are creating two accounts, you need two email addresses.Â Otherwise, pay with a single e-mail address.Â Itâ€™s not possible to use a single email address to create two Airbnb accounts, so donâ€™t even think about it.

# LAST AIRBNB CARD METHOD

In this section, we disclose the steps to create an Airbnb card and get away with it.
While Airbnb carding relies on Airbnb gift cards, the reality is you can be tracked down if you donâ€™t follow the right steps.
Follow the Airbnb carding method below:

Buy Live CCÂ availableÂ :Â Â here

Open one or more Airbnb accounts
Buy an Airbnb gift card online
Add a gift card to your account
Book accommodation



BUY LIVE CC

Of course, the first thing you need is a live CC with high balance.
Preferred CC details are not verified by Visa as it will not ask OTP (One-Time Password) to process the payment you make online for the Airbnb Gift Card.
Note that most of the stores that sell CCs online are fake.Â So you need to be careful not to lose money to other scammers and buy it directly from usÂ hereÂ .

OPEN AIRBNB ACCOUNTS

Next, open an Airbnb account with a VPN â€“ free or paid connected to servers in the country you want to card.Â Assuming you card the UK Airbnb, you need a UK VPN to create an account as a UK resident.
It doesnâ€™t matter if the registration details on your Airbnb account match the CC details.Â However, I recommend that the details match as much as possible.

BUY AN AIR BNB GIFT CARD ONLINE

To purchase an Airbnb gift card, visitÂ Â Â https://www.airbnb.com/d/gift-cardsÂ Â Â and click onÂ Â Â Buy a gift cardÂ Â .Â Depending on the CC balance, you can purchase more than $ 500 worth of gift cards.
Set theÂ Â Â delivery optionÂ Â Â onÂ Â Â EÂ Â Â â€“Â Â MailÂ Â and enter the email address you used to register your Airbnb account in the fieldÂ Â E-mailÂ Â theÂ Â Â recipientÂ Â Â , then add to cart.
Now, sign in to the other Airbnb account you created (not the recipientâ€™s account) and use it to access the Airbnb gift card store.
Complete the transaction by providing the CC details in the credit card payment option.

ADD GIFT CARDS TO YOUR ACCOUNT

After purchasing the gift card and sending it to your recipientâ€™s email address, go to the recipientâ€™s email address and do the following:

Access your recipientâ€™s Airbnb account.
ClickÂ Â Â AccountÂ Â Â in the drop-down menu bar.
Click onÂ Â Â Payment and payments

SelectÂ Â Â Add Gift CardÂ Â .
Now enter the number and PIN from your email to use the Airbnb gift card.

NoteÂ Â : If you canâ€™t access the Airbnb gift card store from your mobile device, you can switch to desktop mode in your browser or use a computer.

BOOK ACCOMMODATION

Once youâ€™ve redeemed the gift card, you can book accommodation at any of the larger hotels your Airbnb gift card amount can afford.

The good thing is that you donâ€™t have to rush around and enjoy the accommodation.
You can keep your gift card balance for as long as you want.
As a carder, your goal is to cash in, not go on vacation.
So you can sell the gift card and get paid.

IMPORTANT

Note that you cannot transfer anÂ AirbnbÂ gift cardÂ once it is added to your Airbnb account.
If you donâ€™t want to use the gift card to book accommodation worldwide, you can sell the account, but at a lower rate than the value of the gift card in the account.
