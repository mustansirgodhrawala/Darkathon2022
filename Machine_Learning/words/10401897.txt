would you buy a gun to shoot a home invader?

Yes?

That's what the vaccine does, it shoots the virus if it invades your body. Can't shoot the virus without a vaccine!

		I always imagined any vaccine to be like a tiny SEAL team -  we gave them the description of the target and sent all of them in for that target only.
Occasionally you get a few that start wildin but that's to be expected as humans may have similar nervous systems but we do not all work exactly the same.

			u/RRRedRRRocket

		I imagine the immune system as an army, and the vaccine as some cardboard enemies. It rattles the army, everyone is alerted, but there is no real threat. Afterwards, the army is trained to react to that specific enemy.
But I also like that SEAL team. Perhaps the vaccine is a SEAL specialist, telling the immune system army how to handle that specific enemy.

They have filters meant to trap exhaled breaths and were designed in 2004 after SARS.   We couldn't give them away as most infection control types stated "well the patient would be in isolation so we don't need them".  I used the seatbelt analogy.

		There's nothing wrong with disbelieving pharmaceutical companies, but pharmaceutical companies are not the sole individuals supporting the vaccine. A quick look at the body of research and the thousands of scientists or scientific agencies worldwide who support the vaccine would make it pretty clear that the vaccine is helpful and safe for the vast majority of takers.

Also, if you want to take a conspiratal angle: Pharmaceutical companies are incentivized to make a good vaccine so they can sell contracts. A shitty or unsafe vaccine would quickly dry up contracts in favor of better vaccines.

What has never happened is a government trying to kill literally the entire population regardless of demographic, including politicians, while also transporting the mechanism for execution to countries throughout the world.

I had some friends that revealed themselves to be anti-vaxxers and told me that if they get sick, they go to the doctor - they don't go to the doctor if they aren't sick. To them vaccines weren't a preventative because they didn't understand the need for preventative care.

It's baffling that people choose to be so ignorant.

		This is a failure of the education system.

Based on the amount of vaccine resistance I have seen here I‚Äôm assuming that the life cycle of micro-organisms, viruses etc, fundamentals of vaccines, dna/rna etc are not taught here at schools. Or a vast number of people didn‚Äôt graduate high school.

I also find it hilarious when people say they don‚Äôt want to alter their own dna by taking a mRna based vaccine.

		If people don‚Äôt want to be vaccinated by choice/idiocy then just let them die. They are adult they make their choices in life.
Now the issue I have with them is that when they are not vaccinated they got infected and then either they go infect other people or they end up  in ER using doctors and treatment to save their f***ing selfish lives. I hope they just all gather together and decide to all go live on an isolated island in the middle of the ocean !

P.S : I have absolutely no issue with people who can‚Äôt be vaccinated because medical condition/whatever real reason. It‚Äôs just with the ones who have a negative count of brain cells, the idiots thinking Bill Gates is controlling people with vaccines 5G etc. seriously those ones I really really want to tell them to go fuck themselves but I can‚Äôt right now because I‚Äôm receiving an order from Bill Gates in my head : I have to turn on my pc to receive an important mail from the Illuminati lizard master on Uranus. Sorry guys, have to leave my phone and go to my pc, it‚Äôs in my head. I can‚Äôt resist Illuminati power.

Fueled by this post and later posts like it, OP's account will eventually be "activated" or sold to someone and used to spread disinformation about politics, science and targeted groups of underserved people.
