                  Description



                If an attacker has in their control
                  0 and
                  0 hashrate,
                  they will be able to generate blocks at the same average speed as the honest network.

                  PoW attack would need 0
                  Ph/s.


                PoW attack requires adding 0
                Ph/s to the existing 0
                Ph/s network hashrate.



              New network hashrate will be
              0
              Ph/s.



              In order to acquire a 0 Ph/s
              hashrate, it would take
              0

              at a cost of $0
              USD to buy them.

              0 kWh.


              Cost of 0

                USD.


              To carry out the attack, additional costs for facilities and cooling are estimated at
              % of the cost of the miner(s).


              The additional facility cost is $0
              USD.

              Current total staked is
              0 DCR.


              An internal %

                0

              Current total staked is

              An external % PoS attack would add
              0 DCR
              to the total staked.


              New total staked will be
              0 DCR.

            Attack not possible. Total coin supply is

            The projected ticket price is
