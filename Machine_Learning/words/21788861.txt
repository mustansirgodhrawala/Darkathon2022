How to upgrade or downgrade your plan



You can upgrade or downgrade your account anytime from within the web app. To do this, go to Settings → Dashboard and select Explore all Proton plans.







Please note that when you change your plan, all changes become active immediately. That means if you downgrade your plan, you’ll immediately lose access to all the premium features that came with your old plan.

However, there will always be a free Proton plan, which we support with our paid plans.



Proton Free



Pricing: Free



We created Proton Mail to bring encrypted email to everyone around the world. We know that some of the people who need our service the most will not be able to pay, so there will always be an option to create a free email address(new window).



Our free plan comes with the same security and ease of use as our paid plans. Here are the main features and limits of Proton Free:



1 email addressUp to 1 GB of total storage (500 MB boosted to 1 GB if you complete your get started actions(new window)) shared with Proton Drive (beta)Short domain email address(new window) (@pm.me): receive messages onlyLabels limit: 3Folders limit: 31 active filter(new window)Easy Switch(new window) import assistantPassword-protected Emails(new window)Additional addresses: not supportedCustom email domains: not supportedSending limit: 150 messages/dayProton Calendar (1 personal calendar)Access to free Proton Drive (beta)Access to free Proton VPN



Unlike many internet companies that depend on invading your privacy to sell ads, Proton is funded by revenue from paid plans. Because we rely on you for funding, and because you rely on Proton to protect your data, we’re always incentivized to keep your data secure and private.



Your subscription pays for the development of new features and services, as well as the cost of running Proton. By upgrading to a paid plan, not only will you get access to advanced features, you’ll support our mission to provide citizens around the world with an internet where privacy is the default.
