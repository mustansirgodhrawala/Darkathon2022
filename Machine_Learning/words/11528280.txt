              Theoretical question. Imagine you are in a middle of your town/city and very very hungry. How would you feed yourself quick?

          the last three days i’ve been in a place where it’s been impossible to get vegan food. they won’t let me bring food in from outside but they don’t provide vegan food inside. i’ve eaten nothing but fries for three days.

          depends on how much money you have at your disposal, but my go-to is hummus and pita if i just need to fill up my stomach/recover from starvation mode.  Veggies are a plus if you can spring for them, work great with hummus.

          I'm that dude that will harvest dandelion out of people's yards if it appears they don't maintain it. If they have well-maintained grass, assume pesticides. If they have an unkept yard without "ornamental" shrubs or trees, I assume they haven't sprayed anything. I'll harvest stuff and soak-clean sometimes, other times just scrub a little.
I'll also ask about fruit-trees that seem to be unharvested. Just saw an apple tree on someone's property with a bunch of apples on the ground...knocked on the door to ask if I could take the fresh ones of the tree. Turned out to be an elderly person who just couldn't harvest em. They let me harvest them as long as I gave them some as well.
