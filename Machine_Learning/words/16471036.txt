Right now bimbos are trending on tik tok and the fully embracing the male gaze growing popular among zoomer women. Along with divine feminism, which is almost an anti-feminism ideology that encourages women to become stay-at-home moms and obedient housewives if they wish to, and assuages their fears about it being demeaning to themselves and women as 3rd and 4th wave feminists are so keen on proselytizing.  One prominent bimbo tiktoker describes the bimbo lifestyle as an "ego death". Where women stop trying to foster masculine traits in themselves and instead cultivate their natural vulnerability, gentleness, and hunger for the sexual desire of men. Bimbos claim these innate traits of most straight women have wrongly been maligned by feminist as naivete, weakness, and subjugation by the patriarchy.I think women gravitating to the antithesis of feminism is primarily due to the deteriorating economy, having a committed husband or boyfriend is quickly becoming a necessity as it has been throughout most of captialism. And bimbos encapsulate in a extreme manner, the things women have always known men want.  I think there's also other converging trends at work. Millennial women are now hitting middle age in earnest, and zoomer generations are seeing the poisoned harvest of feminism. Many millennial women are alone and miserable as either single mothers, divorcees, or spinsters that were never wed and face a future devoid of companionship.Women have also gotten to experience capitalist alienation first hand for 60 years and are realizing that as much as a eunuch a housewife can be, it's still far better than being a prole. Zoomer women are realizing what men have always known, that only a small percentage of workers ever find a fulfilling career, everyone else just works to make money until they die.I think this bimbo trend is the beginning of a wider revolt among zoomer women against feminism. Feminism can no longer hide its failures, and zoomer women cannot be spooked by horror stories of past female oppression like not being able to open checking accounts, since they have no living memory of it.  And even if rights like abortion are taken away, modern technology, like the nearly dozen birth control methods that are available now, will mitigate much of the harm and keep zoomer women from reradicalizing.

I thought that bimbo meant using lots of product like hairspray and make up. How is it related to Sexual dimorphism ?Bimbo, at least as the subculture is now, isn't simply a woman that applies too much makeup or wears clothes that are too revealing. It's a woman that solely focuses on being sexually attractive to men, often forgoing what's fashionable and socially acceptable to other women and society at large. Since feminism posits that men are inherently oppressive of women via patriarchy androgyny, homosexuality and erotophobia are huge themes in this ideology and have since become fixtures in the cultural zeitgeist. Bimbos are a loud rejection of all that. From their thick dick sucking lips, blonde teased hair, thin waists and big boobs, they are among the most extreme expressions of binary gender conformity. The aesthetic is maximizing sexual attraction (often to a comical degree) for CIS Men. The garish look is repellent to lesbians and straight women since it's has zero subtlety. It completely demystifies female sexuality and makes it as base as a males, at least to a feminist's eyes.  Something men appreciate and women see as being to their determent. Obviously it's also the real or implied promiscuity of bimbos that anger feminists as well. You see, it's not that bimbos simply having a lot of partners, most modern feminist women also have body counts that are deep into double digit territory. It's that bimbos will sleep with ANY man. Their entire demeanor is again the antithesis of a feminist's. They're passive, speak softly, and are "dumb" or at least faint it and therefore are not challenging to a male's ego. They're also flirty, and submissive as to make it easy as posPost too long.

How could they possibly afford raising a family. Also many people died very young, before they raised a family. You may have a very distorted view of how capitalism was before social democracy. It was truly awful. Neo-liberalism is a path back to that very shitty past.  >Since feminism posits that men are inherently oppressive of women That's just sexism. Rich Bourgeois women hating on poor working class men. It's just class hatred behind a veil. People like that are really shit, you can go after them specifically, without making it into a conflict between all men and all women. Capitalism ruins everything by changing things into bourgeois versions, that reflect bourgeois class interests. If you look at early socialist feminism, they were just trying to establish man and women as equals, there was no beating each other down. A socialist lady from the early 20th centry called Rosa Luxemburg wrote a long rant about bourgeois feminism, maybe read that. I'm not going to comment on things i consider sexual preference, that's just a recipe for creating unnecessary conflict.I will say that strange stuff is going on, like some people appear to be implying that sexual dimorphism is bad for some reason. Maybe we should push back on that a little, because that seems reactionary. You also have to beware of those that turn filth into theory.Politics is exclusively about economics, if anybody tries to make politics about sex, they are most likely class traitors that are trying to distract you with sex from their reactionary politics. I think that somebody is trying to trick you to hand over your surplus to capitalists. They are just pretending you'll get a nicer girlfriend that way, but they won't deliver, Capitalism wants to make people atomized so they can turn social relations into commodities, they want to be middlemen for intimacy.

While not obstinately red pilled, her critiques of modern women closely follow those of incel ideology.  That women have a SMV (Sexual Market Value) that declines as they age and or have children, that there are winners and losers in this market (Chads and Betas) and the 80/20 rule, 80% of women are going after the top 20% of men.I've been seeing more mainstream incel sympathizing, or manosphere channels popping up on YouTube.  Which is interesting because around 2014-2015 YouTube waged a fatwa on such content and killed all the traffic and success that early Manosphere content creators were enjoying at the time like Sandman who had something like 100k+ subscribers before the YouTube incel purge.And you can't ignore that this woman is really attractive, which makes it a lot harder to dismiss her critique as sour grapes.  Regardless, such an attractive women publicly espousing Red Pill/Incel ideology would have been unheard of even a few years ago, and now there's an entire echo system .To be fair to King, she would say that her views of women are informed by her religion, and not incels.  Have you all seen more incel sympathizing median in the mainstream or near mainstream.I think incels and men's grievance with feminism over all are becoming to big to ignore and are beginning to reach critical mass.Here's a link to her channel, it's quite well established.https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRZAEjMsDpiuVWQk8-OIf9A4 posts and 2 image replies omitted.

I feel that living in this hellscape of social conservatism, hegemony of capital, and violence of the state and the minority who controls it are responsible for a hardening of attitudes regarding sexual partnerships.It becomes a problem to optimize. Solve for optimal sex. Solve for optimal psychological well-being. Solve for career advancement. Solve for properly optimized offspring. It's no different from selecting what institute you will attend after high school, which courses you will take to secure a desired position in society seeking positive outcomes in life.The woolly free-love kind of romantic concept has been rejected by an increasing number of people who in the face of a hardscrabble world, seek out materially beneficial arrangements. It's not just "incel ideology". Female Dating Strategy (FDS) and associated communities and attitudes are spreading amongst women. It represents the embrace of traditional attitudes towards marriage. Returning to "pragmatism" is not a hard sell when the common folk need to be awful pragmatic about budgets and living arrangements and exploitative working conditions.Women are a part of the formulation and enforcement of the memes that enslave them in the same way that men are. We are all participants and authors in this game. The thing that makes people like her and the incels so seemingly anachronistic is that the old rules of the game are changing rapidly (via industrialized society and technology), so much so that nobody knows what they are yet and we have yet to reach a stable equilibrium. Think less "evolutionary psychology" and more game theory. They are easy to mix up.
