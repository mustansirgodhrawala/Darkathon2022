  Mix/Clean    Coins









   
  Why it is necessary
  Using Bitcoins does not protect your anonymity.
  From the moment you buy your coins to the moment you cash it out
  anybody anywhere can see and follow every transaction you ever made
  Mixing your coins breaks the link between your identity and your transactions,
  breaking the chain.
