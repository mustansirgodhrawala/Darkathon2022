      What the heck is Keybase?


















      Keybase is an open source app
Keybase comes with everything you need to manage your identity,
create secure chats, and share files privately. It's free.
It's fun too.
Over 100,000 people have joined Keybase so far to prove their identities, and it's growing rapidly.
