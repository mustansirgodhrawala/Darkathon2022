BRILLIANT COLOR. BLISTERING SPEED.

ROG Strix XG27UQR is a 27-inch DSC gaming monitor with display stream compression (DSC) technology that delivers smooth, 4K visuals at up to 144Hz. It is G-SYNC compatible ready and DisplayHDR™ 400 certified, featuring exceptional contrast and 90% DCI-P3 professional color gamut coverage.

SUPERB IMAGE QUALITY WITH DSC TECHNOLOGY

ROG Strix XG27UQR Display stream compression (DSC) technology* enables 4K visuals and an 144Hz refresh rate via a single DisplayPort 1.4 connection by compressing and decompressing each frame on the fly with no visual loss of image quality.

To enable 4K resolution at 144 Hz with DSC, an NVIDIA® GeForce® RTX 20 series, AMD Radeon™ RX 5700 or higher graphics card is required. For additional information about enabling DSC, contact your graphics card manufacturer.

DISPLAY STREAM COMPRESSION (DSC) TECHNOLOGY

Display Stream Compression technology is an industry-wide compression standard for transporting ultra-high definition video streams across a single interface at high speed with no perceptible loss of visual quality. With DSC technology, the ROG monitor can display incredibly detailed and smooth visuals at native 4K resolution with a 144 Hz refresh rate via a single DisplayPort 1.4 connection without chroma subsampling, which can negatively affect visual fidelity.

Previously, to achieve this level of performance gaming monitors needed two DisplayPort connections to transfer the video signal from the PC, which also often required complex driver configuration and prevented display of high-dynamic-range (HDR) content and variable refresh rates while gaming. The ROG monitor eliminates these issues, supporting both HDR and variable refresh rates via a single DisplayPort 1.4 connection.
