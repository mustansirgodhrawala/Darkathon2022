                Iâ€™m sorry but I couldnâ€™t resist: since Iâ€™ve just written a whole book on the subject, I want to talk about the history of anti-metric sentiment â€” how it connects to political power, republicanism, the French revolution, conspiracy theories, and Brexit. A THREAD:

                just a rumour, but I heard â€¦  that handkerchiefs are coming back? â€¦ that dabbing your glistening forehead with a pristine square of cotton is now... the height of cool?? wow, I guess thatâ€™s convenient for me as a man of copious sweat, but who am I to question fashion ?

                It is just deeply depressing for ALL of us, not just trans people, that as the cost of living, healthcare crisis, and so many urgent matters effecting us - our potential leaders of the country are trying to define what a woman is. Get a grip!

                This is right (and neat).

You'll sometimes see people mistakenly calling these images of lines coming out from the stars "lens flare"â€”but they are really "diffraction spikes" caused by light interacting with the telescope's struts. A good explainer here:

                  From this moment on you will always be able to tell the difference between a Hubble image and a JWST image:

Hubble stars have four spikes in a cross. JWST stars have six in a snowflake. Thank you for your time.

                  there's no way in hell I could have written Beyond Measure without The Internet Archive â€” ESPECIALLY during lockdown when libraries were shut. Publishers' suit against the company is misguided. I just donated to support the archive and you should too.

                  You can read more details on the lawsuit here, but it targets the archive's Controlled Digital Lending program (this works like regular library lending: the buy a book, scan it, the loan it digitally *one-in, one-out* as it were a physical item)

                          A copyright lawsuit threatens to kill free access to Internet Archive's library of books
                          Internet Archive's drama with book publishers is not an anomaly. Many digital libraries have faced similar copyright issues.

                  the publishers in the suit â€” hachette, PRH, Harper Collins, & John Wiley â€” want $19 million; a years operating revenue, for 127 books. you think they didn't get enough out of grisham and gladwell already? you think terry pratchett would support this suit? storage.courtlistener.com/reâ€¦

                    If the Internet Archive loses this case, that sets a precedence that you legally be required to only buy your games, movies, books, and music new; never be able to lend out or sell them; and be required to re-purchase them if you ever need to use them in a new format

                  there's something particularly galling about BMW charging subscriptions for *heated seats* as â€”Â unlike some software services â€“ there is absolutely no ongoing costs for the company itself. you already own the hardware: it's just gouging theverge.com/2022/7/12/23204â€¦

                  also, I've seen some tweets saying "if they could charge subscriptions for safety features like airbags they would" and that's absolutely true - BUT they also sort of already do charge for safety features. you have to pay to record accident footage from your car's cameras

                  It's also interesting seeing the debate over this in our comments section (I love our comments) where the main defense seems to be imagining that BMW will pass its cost savings onto consumers?? (WHAT cost savings? The components are already in there and you pay to run them!!)
