        @ Who we are?
        People (crackers/hackers) who enjoy stealing and breaking passwords into someone else's wallets. We then
            offer these wallets for
            sale. The whole sale is completely anonymous. We do not store any information. Contact: stolenbtcgrp@dnmx.org



        @ Why are wallets so cheap?
        1) Stolen wallets cannot be sold at full price. The maximum price can be set to 10% of the
            wallet balance. We can hardly sell high-volume wallets for dozens of BTCs. Therefore, the price can reach a
            minimum of 0.1%. The bigger the wallet, the less it costs. Attention. we only talk about stolen wallets!
        2) We need to get rid of our wallets quickly. We own them for too long and due to the high
            balance it is not good for us. Split wallets into smaller parts is inefficient for us. The new owner can do
            that.
        3) Due to the high price of BTC, we can afford to sell wallets so cheaply. It is possible
            that in the future we will raise the price to 1% if the price of BTC falls rapidly.
        4) The goal of selling stolen wallets is not to make money, but to get rid of them (change
            the owner) for at least some profit. Theft is more fun for us.



        @ Why can't we use these wallets ourselves?
        Due to the fact that we have illegally acquired them, we run the risk of suspected theft.
            Therefore, it is better for us to simply sell them for some symbolic price. Moreover, in our country, it is
            extremely illegal and it is not realistic to convert such a large amount into our currency. We recommend the
            future owner to use a stock market or mixer or both before transferring them to their own wallet.
