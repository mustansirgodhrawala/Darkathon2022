And that’s no surprise, AR commerce effectively solves one of online shopping’s biggest limitations: not being able to try it before you buy it.Today, consumers are using augmented reality to virtually try out everything, from makeup, sunglasses and hats, to visualizing what virtual appliances, refrigerators and furniture will look like, right in their homes. It’s a significant shift in the way brands and retailers are engaging with consumers to help them make purchasing decisions with more comfort and confidence.As part of our own AR commerce initiatives, Facebook is working closely with Vertebrae to enable 3D and AR product experiences for brands and retailers across Facebook’s family of apps, starting with AR ads on Facebook. In partnership with Vertebrae, we recently co-hosted a panel discussion with luxury brand Coach, and home improvement retailer Lowe’s, who discussed their AR commerce projects.We wanted to share four takeaways from this conversation that might help brands and retailers get started with their own AR commerce projects:Wait, Slow Down: What is AR commerce?AR commerce involves the implementation of 3D product models throughout the path to purchase, with the option to use augmented reality to view a product in real life at accurate size and scale. The result is a more interactive, informative shopping experience, leading to increased consumer confidence in both the product and the merchant. Opportunities for AR commerce are numerous, including social, web-based, search, and in-app implementations, and we’re seeing examples of these from brands and retailers of all kinds and sizes.To activate AR ads on Facebook, Coach created an ad experience that allowed users to virtually try on Coach sunglasses via augmented reality, with the option to purchase — all directly from the ad. At the close of the campaign, Coach reported a significant lift in ad recall, and purchase intent, and is now planning to explore additional AR commerce initiatives.Something Went WrongWe're having trouble playing this video.Learn more#1 Prioritize Quality 3D CreativeWhen it comes to augmented reality, having accurate 3D product models is key, as the realism of the experience is only as believable as the models you’re using. This was especially important to the team at Coach, who were expecting the models to be representative of the quality of the physical products, in this case, sunglasses.“It was really important to my creative counterparts that the tea rose shimmered and the frame had the curve and it did. It looked just like it would in person in the 3D rendering“— Christine Petretta (Sr. Manager, Paid Media), CoachThe need for accuracy in 3D product models extends to all brands and retailers. Consumers are looking for as real of an experience as possible when it comes to exploring products:“For Lowe’s, as a home improvement retailer, visualization is incredibly important. Customers need to understand how a product that they view online or in-store will look and fit in their actual space before making a purchasing decision. To create this experience – and bridge the physical and digital worlds – it’s critical that we use accurate, high fidelity product imagery, including 3D models.“— Ross Neumann (Head of Partnerships) Lowe’s Innovation LabsWhether in-house or via external partners, brands should focus on building a 3D product pipeline that scales to deliver high-quality 3D assets for multiple SKUs, optimized for various formats and channels.#2 Determine Highest Impact ProductsChoosing the right products to feature via augmented reality maximizes the value of the experience. Top sellers and evergreen products are almost always solid choices. Additionally, brands can look to address common questions consumers are asking. For example:"How big is that bag really?" "Will my laptop fit in it?" "What do those sunglasses look like on me?" "Will this chair fit in my space?" AR commerce creates an opportunity to bridge the gap between digital and physical product experiences.“The magic of AR creates a radically different kind of shopping experience that goes above and beyond what digital or physical can offer alone.“— Ross Neumann (Head of Partnerships) Lowe’s Innovation Labs#3 Think Big & StrategicallyAR commerce has multiple distribution points, creating endless opportunities for improving the buying journey for consumers. Whether you’re starting with social commerce via AR ads on Facebook or using 3D and augmented reality on your ecommerce site, a roadmap is in order. Tactically-speaking, there are multiple moving parts, from 3D creative to implementation, to testing and optimization programs, and so on, all of which need to be managed in-house or via a technology partner.To begin determining which distribution channel makes sense for your company, start with your goals. Are you interested in improving engagement, brand lift or purchase intent? Look to social commerce. For increased conversion, consider including more 3D and augmented reality product experiences directly on your ecommerce product pages.“One of the challenges of 3D content production is scale. 3D creates a critical foundation from which we can build countless different experiences that address our customers’ needs in new ways. Given the variety and sheer scale of product categories and unique SKUs we deliver to customers, it’s critical we develop processes and tools that best showcase and standardize 3D content.“— Ross Neumann (Head of Partnerships) Lowe’s Innovation Labs#4 Measure EverythingAR commerce creates new opportunities to boost your engagement metrics, but optimization remains important. For any new initiative, test and optimize and test again. In the case of AR ads on Facebook, we are working to maximize the value of every AR experience for both the brand and the consumer alike.“Not only do we, as the brand, want results, Facebook wants to put a product out there that actually works. They were really stringent around the test methodology that went behind everything. But it all came together seamlessly because Facebook wants it to be valuable.“— Christine Petretta (Sr. Manager, Paid Media), CoachNext StepsWe’re excited about what the future of AR commerce means for shopping as we know it. For brands, it’s an opportunity to build a deeper connection with shoppers, making accessible valuable product information in tangible interactive ways. For consumers, it increases confidence and shortens the path to purchase so that more informed decisions can be made more quickly.As we continue to roll out AR commerce initiatives across Facebook’s family of apps, we look forward to bridging the gap between in-store and physical product experiences — one AR effect at a time.Subscribe to the Spark AR Blog Related StoriesPartnersJuly 28, 2020Pinkfong Boosts Campaign with AR Effect and AR AdBy: Spark AR TeamCreativityOctober 16, 2019Learning AR: Creating Effects with Particles in Spark AR StudioBy: Spark AR TeamCommunityOctober 25, 2019Unmasking the Watchmen Contest WinnersBy: Spark AR Team; Spark ARAugmented RealityLanguagesEnglish (US)DeutschEspañol (España)EspañolFrançais (France)Bahasa IndonesiaItaliano日本語한국어NederlandsPortuguês (Brasil)Português (Portugal)РусскийภาษาไทยTürkçeУкраїнськаTiếng Việt中文(台灣)Spark AR StudioHomeFeaturesLearnPartnersDownloadFAQSpark AR HubManage EffectsSpark AR Community Facebook  Instagram  YouTube Subscribe for UpdatesFacebook for DevelopersScripting ReferencePast Version + ChangelogFacebook for DevelopersScripting ReferencePast Version + ChangelogSubscribe for UpdatesAboutCreate AdCareersPlatform PolicyPrivacy PolicyCookiesTerms;
