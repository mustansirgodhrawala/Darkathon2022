			Deep Web Browsers








		Deep web browsers are programs or applications that allow access to non-indexed websites. Each browser interprets information from different types of files and onion sites on the deep web. These browsers allow viewing of text documents and embedded files. In addition, it allows you to visit onion websites and do activities within the deep web. In other words, link one site to another, print, send and receive mail, among other functionalities.

Getting into the deep web is not difficult, but finding links to "onion" domains on the internet is different. Surely you have heard of Tor Browser as a 'gateway', but there are other options as well. Web browsers like Safari or Chrome are not an option as they will not work. However, there are other browsers besides the Tor browser that serve to enter the deep web or dark web.
It is recommended to use a VPN before you start surfing the deep web. Thus, in this way, you remain anonymous and guarantee the privacy of your personal information. Furthermore, this ensures that you hide the trail of all your activity on the dark web. Although, obviously, this will have a significant impact on browsing speed.

Tor Browser
 
Tor Browser, this browser is the best known to enter the deep web. It is based on Firefox, but with the pre-installation of the Tor proxy, as well as modified versions of the HTTPS Everywhere and NoScript extensions. It is available for Windows, macOS, Linux and Android, and has a 'special' design for deep web browsing. Also, there is no need to delete browsing or history data as closing the Tor browser will erase everything.
Tor's main objective is to ensure that the internet can provide and protect the identity of users. That is, it aims to prevent the information that a user sends to get to him (his IP address) from being tracked. However, Tor's most common use is to take advantage of its features to achieve a certain degree of privacy in web browsing on the internet. Without being specially designed for it.

Invisible Internet Project

Invisible Internet Project is a deep web browser that is available for Windows, macOS, Linux and Android, just like Tor Browser. In addition to being able to access the deep web, we can also use it as a normal web browser. In this case, it is not based on the Tor network, which can also be used, but instead uses its own network so that we can surf anonymously.
All connections are encrypted, including public and private keys, and traffic is 'routed', like in the Tor browser, to avoid tracking. On the other hand, it offers as a peculiarity the storage of files in a decentralized way. But it is much more complicated to configure.

Firefox

Mozilla's web browser, Firefox, is usually the favorite alternative to Google Chrome. And it is very similar, yes, but it goes beyond the Google option, offering us possibilities to enter the deep web. It is available on Windows, macOS, Linux and Android, like the previous ones, but it can also be used on iOS devices, and it is certainly easier to use than those mentioned above.
Now, to access the deep web with this Firefox browser, you must change a configuration: we access configurations within the address bar, and we will have to locate the option network.dns.blockDotOnion to mark it as 'False' for, in the last place, restart.

Whonix

This deep web browser has slightly more limited availability. Because we can only download and install it on Windows, macOS and Linux, not available for mobile devices. However, it is based on the same source code as the Tor browser. So if you are a TOR browser user it will be easy to use. However, there are important changes to highlight, such as a system to protect the user's IP address in any type of activity.
Not even sophisticated malware could discover the computer's IP address. This according to its developers, even having administrator privileges on the system. But it is not a conventional web browser, but part of the Whonix operating system, which runs inside a virtual machine and has more useful tools.

Subgraph OS

This last option, again, is not a conventional web browser, but it is a complete operating system. So again, we can use it on any computer. Like Whonix, the source code on which the operating system is based is that of Tor Browser, but it also has a sophisticated multi-layer system to protect the user's security and identity. Meta-proxy encryption, for example, or file system encryption among many others, and sandbox isolation for applications..
