									                                                        Durban Dream is the tasty byproduct of Durban Poison (Sativa Landrace) and Blue Dream (50/50 Hybrid) which would make the Durban Dream strain a Sativa-dominant Hybrid. The strain is very much Sativa-like, with just a tiny bit of Blueberry (Indica) in the genetics of Blue Dream.

The Durban Dream Strain Predominantly Affects The Mind
Cannabis connoisseurs everywhere know how much Durban Poison leaves a lasting effect on your mind, as it tends to hit you like not many other Sativa strains will. A complete head rush on the inhale, the strain is known to separate body and mind, while combating stress and anxiety in patients. The buds are bright green, covered in even brighter trichomes and thick orange hairs. It looks like an extremely healthy plant to medicate with; small sativa-like buds grown wel.lThe Blue Dream gives the Durban Dream strain a slight blueberry taste on the exhale, which will likely leave you in a haze. It is not the most delicious strains we’ve tested, but its smooth, sweet-tasting vapor certainly makes for a good first impression.
