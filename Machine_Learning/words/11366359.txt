Product Description




The GLOCK 23 combines compact dimensions for both open and concealed carry, with minimum weight, despite its large magazine capacity in .40 caliber. Having survived durability tests and use by U.S. Law Enforcement agencies, the G23 pistol has repeatedly demonstrated its world-class durability and reliability in even the most unfavorable conditions. Thats why countless police authorities continue to adopt the GLOCK 23 as their official service pistol.
Each pistol is delivered only after passing stringent quality inspections, exhaustive quality control checks, and test firing in the factory.
Your new Glock 23 Gen3 pistol is delivered as a factory new, complete set. The hard shell case which houses your pistol also includes a speed loader, two magazines, a cleaning set, a cable lock and instruction manual.
