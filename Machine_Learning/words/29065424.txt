            Introduction By Ugu
            First of all, I would like to thank everyone involved in this project so much for their hard work! I could not have made this happen without the work of a sizeable group of anonymous artists. My name may be here, and my funding was integral, but their hard work is what made this possible.

                Whether you are new to the darknet or you are a veteran, I hope you will enjoy this music. We are criminals, but we are right, and the message of free trade and bodily autonomy is more important than any law or the jack booted thugs who enforce it. If you take one thing away from this, I hope it will be that you no oppressor has more of a right to your body than you do.

                This album is dedicated primarily to Ross Ulbricht and Alexandre Cazes, but also to everyone else who gave up their futures to fight for our rights and safety. They will not be forgotten. One day the history books will remember them as freedom fighters. But sadly, not today.

                    #1 NOOBMASTER



                        Let introduce me, I was born in 88
                        I was a student at the bay
                        This is how I started in this game
                        This is how I become and switch the lane

                        I was nobody at that time but I wanted to learn
                        Watch and Earn Reading books and make it burn
                        A friend told me something about the net
                        Something wake in me I started to make a change

                        I spent hours Locked on the screen
                        I saw so many things that I could not believe
                        many things that caught my attention
                        things that I preferred not  even mention

                        Unknowing the truth on everything
                        A dark world  I can buy anything
                        A dark world  drugs and medicines
                        A dark world was in front of me



                        I was a noob
                        Who become in master
                        Master plans

                        Mindless self to destroy
                        we got coins to make noise
                        don't name after yourself
                        So many histories to tell
                        All that mistakes we fall
                        buyers want to bring us down
                        Pigs are inside of the clouds
                        Drugs are inside of the crowds
                        Camel got the pockets out
                        Trust no one we can fall for a scam
                        All they want it’s  to bring us down
