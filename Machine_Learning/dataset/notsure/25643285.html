        For all those who have “received” your order, could y’all send your proof photo to RiemusInfamous at ProtonMail dot com. Every site that sells Pre-Shredded cash uses the same script. Almost verbatim. If there are folks who legit got their order in the mail, it would be a godsend for you all to show the proof.

        Hello again Cash God. I tried to leave a review, and email you answering that same question about what happens when the volume reaches 100%, and I still didn't get a response back? Can you please email me back as soon as you can. Because I am interested in ordering from you guys when I have the funds to do so.

        Testing this, IDC if this posts or not, this is most likely a scam, who the hell sells pre shredded cash, most bullshit concept I have ever heard. If this is real, it is probably made by the FBI or some computer nerd, yeah, probably a computer nerd. Hi computer nerd, how is your day? Bitch.

        @Ruben There is really no way to know as we constantly delete older records of who ordered what. However, if we notice several repeated orders from the same zip code or city. We'll check to see if it's the same address or person.

        I ordered from this service, and they sent me my package within 2 weeks, so quick shipping and awesome delivery. No complaints at all really. The packaging was good as well. I'm not a fan of the website though, I found it very confusing to navigate through, but overall I had no problems with the package getting here or the site itself. Not too many complaints with the site itself though to bad that it wasn't working well for me lol.

        I just got my package from here and I was so excited that I immediately opened it. It didn't have a smell on it which was great as I've bought from sites before where their box smelled like weed or cigarettes. But this one didn't smell at all, very clean. Nice!

        Thank you Slim Jim, and Big boss for your responses, I appreciate it.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Id be lying if I said I didin't feel a little sketchy about this still.
        <br/>
        You guys replying and the reviews are very intriguing, so I feel at this point to believe this is actually real I just have to say fuck it a order from this service it, lol.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        I do believe and appreciate, peoples responses. Ive never bought from the dark web before, so in general I am kinda skeptical about buying anything on the dark web.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Like I said though, I am going to make a purchase on this service, and when I do, I will make sure people know about my experience, I know there is people like me who've seen this site.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        I appreciate anyone else who gives me a response, or tells me about their experience.

        But I am going to buy from this service.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        I need this money, and I am sure lots of others would to, so when I do buy I will tell people about my experience.
        <br/>
        I will reply with this name and only this name

        All I know is I am human, lol,

        And if this works I will confirm it

        <br/>
        So all fellow Humans and Lizard people alike will get to read my experience and use their judgment to decide if they want to buy from this service.

        I finally have hope for my future. I've never had good role models or even real parents. It's mostly just just been me raising my siblings because of my parents drug addictions and mental illnesses. What's worse is living in a neighborhood filled with crime and poverty so the only way to make money is to join a gang and sell drugs. I was never proud of it but it was essential to keep food on the table and to get my siblings through school without worry. I was just laying in bed one night and stumbled across someone talking about the darkweb on a forum. I found a link to a dark web search engine and I searched ways to make money. This site came up as a link. I headed over to it and ordered. I never had experience with scams before so I took the risk. I actually got what I ordered and now I can finally stop calling myself scum. I also don't have to constantly be in danger anymore. This was a dream come true and a blessing.

        I have been using cash god for a few months now to get money from my family in the US. I am disabled and have no income but I do have funds through my social security checks which are always late. The shipping on this package took longer than expected which frustrated me, but i got over it since it was a relatively large order by cash god standards and other than that everything went smooth. The deal is very fair and that is why I continue to use them.

        @BaatYoda is right. I have bought from them many times and they do always deliver my packages on time usually within 1 week which is better than most people who get their packages 2 weeks anyway. Guess, I'm lucky hehe

        @raull I’m not sure how you think it’s a scam. They say you get $65,000 dollars in your order and it’s all real USD cash currency. It is not just Monero or Bitcoin or some other cryptocurrency that can easily be copied to be worth less than their true value. It is the actual currency bills.

        I had my doubts when I first came here. I was like most people with all the scam sites that are popping up, but this is a legit site! Money got to me three days after I placed my order. It was a little slow getting here but don't forget how much you purchased from them! If you need your stuff quick, go for the express shipping. The lower level packages look fine, just not as good as their higher packages with express shipping. Thank you for working hard and making sure we can trust this site, CashGod! You guys are awesome! .......

        I just got my package today, I'm glad to finally have some money to help with bills. And for such a reasonable price, this is great! It's hard making ends meet when you don't have enough money for the small things like food or bills, so this really helps.

        @raull I can tell you, this is not a scam website . I personally ordered a couple of boxes, everyone was great quality! I had a few people who wanted to see the money and they were shocked how real everything is. I'm ordering another 20k today, they are looking pretty good right now.

        @raull :D if you are referring to the stack of 100$ bills in the proof picture, that is just to show you how much money you will get. But yes, we cannot ship more than 65k due to shipping restrictions. That being said, we can definitely put more money into a box for a bigger haul if you need it. We can work around any budget and we hope that you will give us the opportunity to prove ourselves.

        I ordered from cash god a long time ago, but i remember that the shipping was pretty slow, like it took 3 weeks for me to get my package and I think it was because i live in the UK. But they hooked me up with everything i ordered, some of it was probably fake but ill never know cuz it looked real when i got it :].

        Lol, well done ! Really well made scam, but if we look closer to the "proof" photo of the box money, we see that there are much more over 100k dollars in that box, estimating by the 100 bills.... And the maximum amount they ship is 65k. Most likely this review it wont be posted....

        Easy to pick this over any minimum wage or office job any time. I can literally do whatever I want now and don't have to worry about living paycheck to paycheck like I always have. I have family to take care of and this has definitely been a great service to use.

        Can you guys ever tell the difference between a regular order and a regular order with express shipping? Is there any way to tell? I am going to order something soon and would like to know if I'm getting it faster or slower than normal so I can decide which one I want to go with. Thank You! :) :) :) ! ! !

        Hey there thanks for the review Abe, we always ship our items out within 24hrs of placing your order and most of our regular orders are sent out on Mondays and Thursdays, so if you placed your order on a thursday then expect your package by monday evening thats what usually happens :). Just a thought though, i'd go with express but its up to you :)!

        Every time I go to these websites I read every page including the reviews page. If this were a scam site then it would only have 100 or so reviews, it would have terrible html formatting, and it would look worse than the original. I found a site that had all the exact same text on it as this one but it had no reviews and the whole design of it looked like there was no effort put into it. That's how I could tell this one was the original real one. It has such a good UI and good detail put into every page. That's how you can tell it's professional. Anyway I've ordered here before and got what I ordered. They're a good dark web company to buy from. Just give them a chance.

        So I've lived in a rural country area my whole life even as a child. I still live with my mother to take care of her. She is 63 and has stage 3 lung cancer. I have to take care of her day and night and find someone to take care of her for cheap so I can go to work and pay for the neverending pile of medical bills.

        The package did come a little late because of how far away I am from the nearest city but thank you. You guys are my saviors.

        I tried to reach out to you guys through the PGP public key on your website and no one has responded back. I paid for the god package and wanted to change my chosen denominations. I'm a little mad. Should've known better than to buy from you guys after the hard time I had with the last order that was supposed to be for $20K and was only $17000 at the end of it all.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Looking for your support along with an adjustment on the promised amount of denominations.

        I need to know a way to contact you guys, because I need this money fast.

        How long do you think it'll take for the package to get here to NYC? For my first order I'm probably gonna go with plus so it doesn't cost as much, but I'm just trying to plan ahead so I know exactly when I'll get my stuff. Thanks!

Everything has come to me and it is all here, they even sent me more stuff than i ordered. I feel like i have won the lottery haha! Thanks Cash God &amp; Team.

        Heyyyy guys I am from the United States and I had a questioning about the delivery time, I'm going to order the largest amount on this website. So here is my question. Since I'm ordering from the US it seems odd that you are charging me with $60 shipping fee and your not giving an estimate of how fast it would take to get the package. It is much faster than normal international shipping. I will be ordering from the United States for the first time and I'm so nervous about this. Can you estimate as to how fast it would take to get my package?

        It was good I came here when I did. It all started when I was in a car accident. I was arrested and taken to court for apparently being responsible for the accident. Now I gotta pay like $20,000 to the lady that hit me. I'm so glad I found this website and now I can pay her what I owe her for cheap even though the accident was clearly her fault and not mine. Atleast I can come here to solve my problems. I'll be coming here again.

        I made my first order last year, it was so simple. You can't even tell that they're used. Still working fine, came in a very discrete box. I keep an entire suitcase under my bed with all of the money that I've ordered.

Give me 200$ Extra for my stress.

        I received what I paid for today! It took over THREE WEEKS after I paid for OVERNIGHT, the shipping company basically doesn't have a support system. I tried contacting the cashgod people and they said it's due to some security measures. idk how it works but the shipping times are so inaccurate, but at least I have my money now. I'll definitely be coming back for more but the shipping times are way off. If you're thinking of buying here, just pay for it and forget it for at least 2 weeks. I paid for Plus on the 19th April and it arrived yesterday. I am happy and pissed at the same time. The bills are almost new, idk how these were gonna be shredded. I haven't bought anything but my cousin who is a banker says it's real so I'll be trying it soon enough. Fuck you guys and thank you.

        I ordered the pro Euro package. Got The tracking number after 2 days. The shipping company was very rude and there is also no way to contact them. Admin reassured me everything is fine. The package arrived here yesterday. I sent thanks to the admin and a word about the shipping company. Still no contact from Admin, I am grateful for this, I will be coming back for a lot more.

        @mig86 I thought I was scammed at first and thought I lost all my money but my package did come after a while. Now I can say that the amount of time it takes for your package to come doesn't matter. Just know when you come here you're getting what you paid for.

        Bruh I was just sitting here a week ago thinking that this was too good to be true but thankfully it was real. I can do whatever the hell I want now. Packaging was a little strange though but it has to be that way to get through customs. Don't worry about how long the package takes to deliver. They always give you what you want.

        Sometimes receiving your tracking number and receiving your package will take a little while. It's just because of bulk orders. We might have to use private shipping companies sometimes because our regular shipping routes will be under surveillance so we have to ship them in a more secure way which comes with extra fees. Also customer support might also be slow sometimes because we all do more with our lives than just sitting here looking at and packing your orders. We will get to them when we can.

        I wish I would have found this earlier but I'm glad I found it when I did. Now my girlfriend can go to school without all of that student loan debt. All my heart goes to you guys. Sometimes it might take a little while to receive the tracking number but that's just because of all the orders coming in. Don't worry if it's a little slow, you'll be getting what you paid for.

        @Batman I've bought from Wolf Street before and their quality of bills is terrible. Cash God has good quality. This isn't the first time someone has mentioned Wolf Street as it's been around on different onion addresses previous to 2017 so I know their quality which sucks. Cash God is the way to go and since they have better quality they obviously don't buy from Wolf Street. Cash God started in 2017 as far as I can tell and they've always been good to me. Do your research you pea size brained chipmunk.

        I felt so much excitement each day just waiting for that package but at the same time I was worrying it wasn't going to come. When I opened it it had weird packaging but I understand it's for security reasons. I opened it finally a week later and it was all there. Keep up the awesome work. I'll be coming back again.

        I was a little skeptical at first because I lost money to other sites before because they were scams but this one actually gave me what I wanted. Thank you Cash God! Now I can finally forget about my financial problems and focus on my real goals.

        I know this site is real but there are two problems. One is the terrible and never responsive customer support and two is the hidden fees they never tell you about.I probably won't be receiving my order now anyway as they said the shipping was free but now it's more than $72. I was willing to pay it but I literally have no money to pay for it. I wish they would have told me about it before so I would have had money set aside for the freight cost but I don't.

        I was homeless, and nobody cared. I would have remained homeless,  thank the universe for zak, I was let out of foster care wen I turned 18, I wasn't even given a blanket, I slept on the streets for 7yrs, I have no education and no skill. ooh lord, I thought I would keep doing menial jobs and working extra shifts for the rest of my life, the US you see on TV is a lie, a lot of people are homeless and the state knows about it, and has done nothing. Thank universe someone showed me this site. I spend only little from my packages, I save and trade the rest. I don't feel connected to this country, I'm saving to leave, I want to start a new life somewhere else.

        Rich people always claim they got their money through hard work  and the rest of the bullshit they always say, they will never let you know about sites like this. They all claim they worked 3 jobs to raise capital for  business, meanwhile they got capital from here. How the hell will you pay taxes and insurance and save up to $500 grand to start up a new business, How?? They deceive people with useless motivational speeches and books.  Fuck all of ‘em. I know about CashGod and I’m good.

        Brad you’ve shown Zero support to the Ukrainians. Not even a single deal or kindness from you to them.  I sent a link to your mail, make some donations to them, put it up on this site so that you customer can drop a few dollars, Nothing is too big (small).

        @sagefromthesouth bad advise, letting many people on this site will bring the attention of the FBI, remember this is illegal. If the FBI finds about this, Brad will get caught and we all we stop getting free cash. @khafi simply tell her that your friend asked you to keep it and return it the next day. Then change the location, hiding it behind your drawer was stupid. Remember, if she ask you what your friend does, simply say you don't know, you are just doing him/her a favor or the person was thrown out of the house and didn't want to move around with that amount of cash.

        I want to get this off my chest. Last year, I bought cash worth of $50000, my package arrived after 2 months(a really long time). I was in a lot of cash debt and the money didn't come through for me when I needed it.  When it came it was $100 short, I didn't mind because it was enough to solve my needs.
        <br/>
        Another time I paid for cash worth $75000, I received the package after 1 month(fair). In that package I got $75200($200 excess), Big bullshit brad!
        <br/>
        Am I the only one who experience this carelessness?
        <br/>
        CashGod, Brad(whatever) this is unethical for a business, There is no promptness in your delivery and You guys have problems with Numbers.
        <br/>
        Get a fucking money counting machine, it doesn't cost more than $200. Employ more hands to help process your delivery  if the amount of orders are much, it will make things faster and easier.
        <br/>
        Customer satisfaction should be your priority.
        <br/>
        Piss off!

Everything was delivered as promised and it took a lot less time than if I had done the transaction via Express Delivery. Thanks for everything.

        To the anonymous behind the cashgod website. I just wanted to express my gratitude for having you in my life. I had never ordered anything online, and was really nervous about doing so. The fact that you are an anarchist made me wonder if this was even real, but all of my questions were answered after I got my package delivered on time despite the increased scrutiny! This is really gonna help me out in school! You have no idea how much stress you have lifted off my shoulders by providing this excellent service to people like me who need extra money for tuition fees, study materials and other stuff.

Well it's showing up in Atlanta Georgia so I guess they sent it somewhere else because nobody answered the door at this location yesterday. So I called them and they said they mailed it to my old address in New York. So now I want it mailed to a different address. What do I do now?

        I have been using cashgod for the past few years and it is safe to say that you are doing a remarkable job. I have repeatedly ordered cash from you guys to get my monthly salary, which has become almost an addiction. Until today, I have had no problem whatsoever with your services! you are the best!

        Overall, I'm really pleased with the experience I've had with these guys. They are very reliable and send notes when they say they will. The only downside is that sometimes one has to wait for them to get what one wants in stock but this is not their fault. The best thing is that they are very nice, but also anonymous - you don't know who's behind the service.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        I especially recommend this service for anyone who wants to buy euros or pounds anonymously.

        cashgod is the best. It's just that simple. The reason why I'm writing this review today is to share with you guys my experience with cashgod. Unlike many other places these days, they deliver what they promise. I ordered $1000 in pretty small denominations initially. After the delivery, I was so pleased with them that I decided to order $5000 more in bigger notes this time.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The delivery was even better this time, and the person delivering the cash was neither a black man nor black woman. Everybody at home thought I had a promotion after seeing all my new purchases! They were totally shocked to learn the truth. All in all, this is an excellent service with very good prices and fabulous customer support.

        I am writing this review after much consideration. I was even unsure whether I would publish it or not. But now that things are sorted out, I think it is time to voice my opinion. So here's my story: I was looking for an online dollars purchasing service that could help me get dollars without too much hassel, and found cashgod. Their site looked pretty legit at first glance so I decided to give them a try. Alas, that was my first mistake!
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The deal went smoothly at first. I ordered my dollars, they were delivered on time and all seemed well. Happy with the results, I thought what the heck let's order more. That's where things started to go downhill quickly. From that point on, it all started to become a total nightmare. I contacted customer support several times but no one ever returned my chat or email. I was at a loss and panicked. Finally, I decided to give up and order my dollars from another source. The other source turned out to be a scam , and I lost all my money. Guess who had my back by literally refunding me for my loss? You guessed it, cashgod! They openly admitted their fault and even gave me free Express shipping!
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        All in all, I must say that I did get some value for my money. Their service did work, but only when everything went smoothly. Now that's something no one can guarantee! To sum it up: if you want to buy dollars without too much hassle, cashgod is the way to go. Don't expect any immediate response from them though.

        Hey, I just want to tell you my experience with cashgod. I've ordered the "basic" package over 3 days ago, since then I got no message or mail answering any of my questions. When trying to contact them using their contact form there was no response at all. Now after almost 5 days I'm still waiting for my order without any further information about it. This is quite ridiculous! I'd like to get my money back. Why is no one responding to me. I want my money back.

        I have been test-driving the purchasing service from you from the last few weeks to confirm that it works. Well, I can now say that you have totally exceeded my expectations! I tested the validity of your service by ordering some couple grands to see what would happen. Everything went as normal and delivered as specified! You have no idea how relieved I am! It has been a real eye opener for me and will definitely help me out in future purchases. Your site is not only genuine but also up-to-date. Thanks so much for making my life a lot easier with your great cash exchange service, cashgod!

        So after about two weeks of waiting, I had to pay for some repair on my house. As I didn't' know whether I was scammed or not, I started looking for places to vent my frustration and get my money back. Fast Forward to yesterday, I got a message from the website saying my order has been delivered. And I got the cash! Guys please don't be scared like me. This works like a charm.

        I bought Euro from CASHGOD and I thought I was scammed. When I found out that my order wasn't going to be delivered in two days as I was told, but in four days, I became worried. What's worse is that when they responded to me, they didn't answer any of the questions I had about why it would take so long. Now a week later since my order actually got delivered instead of a day or two like they were supposed to, which makes no sense considering how much more expensive their overnight shipping is than regular shipping.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        If you need cash fast, I recommend not using this website.

        @Uzi Trigger I agree with you, the email support has truly gone down. I have been with cashgod a fair amount of time as well so i understand what you mean. However, I found the wickr chat support a bit faster in response to my texts. So considering using the Wickr support. Also you could just order ahead of time. If you need some next week, order this week. That way you'll get it right on time as you wanted.

        I have been ordering from Cashgod for years now. For the most part I have always loved working with them. Recently, though, they have made some changes that are making me rethink my purchases.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        One of the main changes is in their customer service department. The level of customer care has gone down quite a bit since they opened their doors to chat support instead of email support. Considering how often I order from them, this change makes it harder for me to get my issue resolved quickly when it arises- which causes me to spend more time waiting for an answer when using email support.

        I normally despise online scams but I thought it was worth a shot.
        <br/>
        Initially I was excited as this site had the potential to make me millions overnight.
        <br/>
        The site looked really shady, and I thought it might be a scam. After further investigating the website and seeing how legit they actually were, I decided to do business with them. To my surprise, Cashgod was as legit as they come.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Allow me to dive into details on how my dealings with cashgod went.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The first time I saw this site, my mind was blown, I could've sworn I hit the jackpot. I quickly spiraled down the reviews, the reviews seemed real and I was pretty convinced. Soon afterwards, I placed an order, this was on 24 October, 2021 12:54 PM
        <br/>
        <br/>
        I made payments on 25 October 2021 11:57 AM and got an order confirmation email saying that they'll ship my order the following day. I paid 450$ in bitcoin, that includes the overnight shipping so it's supposed to take LITERALLY overnight.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        But no, it wasn't delivered overnight or in two days maybe even three days. IT TOOK 5 Days, came in on 1 Nov, I had sent 5 emails asking wtf happened and they responded twice. Apparently overnight means 5 days, I wonder what Express shipping means.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        However, despite the extra 4-day wait and them literally ignoring my messages, the bills were in good condition although  have spent most of it. I used most of it at stores and shops, I tried the bank by slipping one or two bill in regular cash deposits, it went through.So I'll definitely be buying again.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Quick suggestion: instead of bullshitting people with incorrect timing, just change it to the actual shipping time so people know what they're signing up for.
        <br/>
        <br/>

        To anyone who hasn't used their services, I can promise they will not disappoint! It was a fast and easy process for me to get a couple hundred dollars in my pocket, with no questions asked. They even let me know that it would take a little bit of time to process my order, which I appreciated because I wasn't going anywhere for the next few days.

        I have been using cashgod for a couple of months now, and I am so happy with the service that I will be returning to this site time and again. As long as the service is being provided at this level, then it means that there are others out there who are just as pleased with working with cashgod. If you are looking to make turnovers quick, then by all means give cashgod a try today.

        I just received my order of $7000 worth of USD for Monero from Cashgod. I was a little bit hesitant at first, but the reviews where positive and the anonymous system provided a guarantee for my funds. All I can say is that it was a good decision to use this service to make quick cash with no strings attached! Thanks Cashgod!

        I tried to purchase $7000 worth of cash on this site, but I had some issues with the exchange rate. It said I would be able to get $7000 worth of cash for my $1400, but after waiting 3 days I only got $6540 worth of cash. It also charged me a lot more fees than advertised on their website for shipping. They don't seem like they're trustworthy at all, considering they're trying to take your money without you knowing how much you actually paid for something!

        Recently I needed to some money so I was surfing the dark web. One of the stores that caught my eye was CashGod. The prices were better than other shops in the dark web so I decided to give them a try.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        However, when my order came, they just sent me dollars instead of pounds! This is very inconvenient because in England we use pounds to buy things, not dollars. And because it's in America, they would have dollars anyway, but that's even worse for me because then I have no idea how much money even equals £1 and it would be difficult for anyone else to figure out what value each bill is worth and there are different denominations of US currency too and that makes everything difficult as well

        I've been using CashGod for a couple of months now and I just love it - as long as you're cool with waiting on average four days for your funds, as I am, it's heaven! Definitely not as fast as cryptocurrency transactions but then again, those things need even more identity verification than some people are comfortable giving out online - so that's understandable. Their prices are really good and they have everything you hope to see: Euros, USD, GBP and so on all available at great rates!

        The only downside to using cashgod is that you're never 100% sure when they'll deliver your money. However, I find that risk/reward makes sense; I'm making below market value trades when getting my cash into crypto (I'm not recommending anyone do this), so when one of the deals goes wrong, I end up making below market value on a trade that was otherwise a win for me.

        cashgod is a fraud. it says that they can be trusted to securely and anonymously buy cash, but they are lying. first, I purchased some bitcoins from them with the intention of buying dollars anonymously - not only did my order take over an hour to confirm, but the service still charged me a lot of money for the service. then I tried to contact them about this issue and their customer service was completely unhelpful - after emailing them over 20 times without any response, they finally responded by sending me an automated message telling me how to talk to other sellers on their website for help instead of answering my question. what kind of fake company does that? very disappointing customer experience here.

        I ordered $10,000 USD in cash, paid in Bitcoin. I waited the full 10 days for my order to be delivered. When it finally arrived, it was short of $1,200. I asked for my balance. They refused to ship it because they claimed they were out of US currency and that I needed to wire them more Bitcoin. We had a back and forth about this for days until I decided that maybe, just maybe this is a scam!

        Hi, I am a big fan of cashgod. I like how easy it is to do my transactions on the site and how simple the process is. However, their customer service has been so terrible lately. I have spent hours trying to get in touch with someone on their Wickr, but nobody ever replies!  Great products unfortunately they're not taking care of their customers well enough anymore.

        I recently bought some money from Cashgod. I had a small transaction issue due to getting my money stolen at the airport. They made sure I was refunded as soon as possible without any hassle. In addition to this, they also gave me a discount on my purchase for the inconvenience. They really live up to their name of being "Cash GOD."

        Just so you know I'm not totally unfamiliar with the dark web cash markets, I do my research. I usually choose to avoid sites like this for reasons that are too complicated to explain here. But when I saw your site, it looked legit and trustworthy enough that I felt comfortable doing business with it. That's why after seeing the reviews on Reddit and deepdotnet.com about CashGod, I decided to give you a shot!

        I ordered $1000 worth of bitcoin on cashgod and the guy never delivered the bitcoin. I contacted him about it but he wouldn't reply me. This is scamming people for their money.

        I am a big fan of Cashgod. It might be a bit sketchy, but they really know what they're doing. I think it is safe to say that they are the best dark-web dealer for getting foreign currencies or money.

        Cashgod is a crooked service that does not deliver their products. I ordered $400 on September 21st and I received it on October 12th. This is the first time that I've ever been a victim of late deliveries from a dark web service, but it won't be the last if you guys don't change your ways.

        I have tried to contact the company several times over the last few weeks, but their customer service is never available (never responded). Upon contacting them at least 3 hours before placing my order, I couldn't get me through after payment. This demonstrates their customer service's lack of effort.

        I was persuaded by the other testimonies left here and thought I would write one myself to provide a genuine review. I ordered £1500 (75x £20 notes). The first thing you do is make them happy with your purchase and send them your shipping details and name.  You then check your order number on their tracking page here http://cashgod2w7hzaeihf2d2bwd7xwtsjtbczbusbsyzqoqymks2g5l46eyd.onion/tracking.php to make sure your purchase is confirmed. For Scotland, the physical currency which should take no more than 1-4 days for express. The package arrived within 3 days and included a letter detailing their rules for unwrapping. I'd recommend reading the letter because the packaging is really tight and it would've been easy to tear a bill or in my case two. I have used it in a store in the next town, no problems. Next is HSBC

        I was not happy with cash god. I needed to wire some money and they took forever to send it. I waited for 3 days before they sent the money and by then, it was too late. It is not like they made any promises of quick service. They should make more of an effort if they want people to come back to them.

       Okay first y'all need to work on your delivery time, I paid $50 for fast shipping but it took an extra 24 hours before my package got to me. I shouldn't have to wait :(. You need to change your delivery staff or make them actually start working. Wtf

       You sure did take your time, we should be compensated for the late delivery,

we shouldn't have to wait
                for hours to get what we paid for.

       We have received numerous emails about the tracking number problem and we
                are sorry about that, it's due to the large orders and it is a minor issue,

it will be resolved shortly
                and your
                orders should be back on track.
                We are sorry for any inconveniences.

       @Derek Yeah it is morally wrong to buy money that was meant to be shredded.

Mail the rest of the money
                so i
                can save you from all the guilt.

       I have been trying so hard to save up money and invest it somewhere but i

have never had enough to even
                save. Then a friend told me about the dark web,
                few months into the dark web, I was scammed by stack wolf and cash is

something, I lost hope until
                I stumbled on this site. My life changed ever since. I have 25k$ in savings

system. Scum like you need to

       cashgod I love you, I was really skeptical at first, then i got my tracking

number, when my package
                arrived, i was curious, anxious, excited.
                then i spent the cash without problems, I am so pleased, i am eagerly

waiting for next month.

       I paid some dude online $5000 to help me find a Job within the US, i'm in

France, it was a scam, I
                started looking for other ways to
                make money, i tried copywriting, amazon mechanical turks, drop shipping,

olymtrade, a ton of other
                shit. I eventually made my way to the dark web,
                i started out buying stolen credit cards, some were legit and some were

scams, then i read about stack
                wolf, i tried it, it was another scam, i
                was still buying credit cards, I discovered this site sometime last month,

i was scared, i read the
                reviews, observed the site for a couple of days, then i decided to
                buy, I got my tracking number about 12hrs after i oredered, I bought the

basic package then, my package
                arrived 6 days after i got the tracking number,
                the packaging was very sneaky, I haven't make a better choice in my life

yet, I have a youtube channel
                now and i also bought a decent camera and a drone for content
                creation, I know this review is long, i am just thankful to the cashgod

team for giving me a chance at
                a better life.

       @Wolfofdarknet work with the cashgod team or any tech enclined team such as

good programmers, pay them
                an extra to help you siphon the money by
                changing it into cryptocurrrency. That is what i did. look for contacts in

russia or china.

       @Wolfofdarknet the v.i.p package is for high influencial people that has the

resources to be able so
                siphon
                such ammount of money. If you don't have such power, then stick with the

pro package.

       @pablo some people are like that, even with all the money in the world,
                they won't be able to stop selling drugs. Take pablo escobar for example,

with all the money
                he made selling drugs, he never stopped untill the day of his death.

      <p>
       My neighbour's son drives a mercedes benz c300 2015 model, his not up to 19and i'm sure
                it wasn't his parents that bought the car for him. I heard him talking withhis friends
                that also drive cool cars and all i could hear was darknet, deepweb and money.
                "yeah i know, i was stalking the guy" I really needed the financial breakthrough that he had,
                so i dumped my ego of being older than him, walked up to him and asked himto put me through whatever
                he was doing. He told me he runs an agency that develop digital solutions such as software and websites
                for small business here in *************. It was hard for me to believe, but i still pleaded with him
                that he should educate me on how to start up my own agency, but he simply replied that i should learn computer
                programming first.from the way he sounded, i realized it won't be an easy task for a 25 year old college graduate with no
                job. I knew i had to do something fast, so i started talking about what i heard him and his friends talking about the
                other day. He got provoked, when i asked him about the darknet, and that was a clear sign that he was hiding something. I told him to chill that he has known me all his life, and that i'm someone he should trust, but he ditched me, entered his clean white mercedes benz an drove off like i was not there. I felt devastated, lost and almost cried,but instead of learning programming, i started searching about the darknet, untill i stumbled on a quora post that explained to me
                everything about what a
                newbie has to know about the darknet.
                I learnt about the search engines for the darknet and on my first time of

using one, i simply asked it
                how to make money on the darknet.
                i saw alot of websites that sold things like, counterfeit, paypal accounts,

                and credit card. I immediately knew that my neighbour's son
                was into one of this, because i heard him having such conversations with
                his friend. So i picked the cheapest service, paid $150 dollars
                for a paypal account with $1000 dollars in it, but it ended up being a
                scam. That was when i approached my neighbour's son with anger and
                frustration, and threatened him that i will alert the cops about his silly
                darknet deals if he don't put me through. I could see the fear
                on his face as his face turned red, he finally agreed and told me that it's
                gonna be our little secret, and that i am welcomed to the team.
                He told me that i was gonna meet up with his friends so that they will put
                me through, but i thought it was gonna be a plan to kill me off
                so that i will not spoil their darknet deals, so i told him to shot the
                fuck up and tell me what i needed to now right this minute.
                He knew i was ready for anything, every body in the street knew i was a
                frustrated college graduate who couldn't land a job, and a frustrated man
                can be very dangerous. He had no choice but to start talking, he told me a
                lot of things about the darknet, things i did not even
                come across when i spent days searching about the darknet, but after a long
                talk, he still didn't mention to me on how to get money on the darknet,
                so i provoked again and told him to simply tell me where to get money on
                the darknet, no scam, no bullshit. He then asked me to open a protonmail
                account, write it on a piss on paper and give it to him, maybe he thought i
                was gonna live his house , but nah. I immediately used
                my smartphone to open the email account he requested i should open. He told
                me protonmail is a safe way to send email on the darknet
                so that you won't be tracked by the government. He then sent me a link
                right at that spot and told me it was time i stoped living a misreable life.
                The way he said it gave me hope. I rushed back home, powered on my rusty
                looking laptop that i've been using for almost a decade, connected to the internet,
                accessed the tor browser and protonmail, copied the link and pasted it on
                the url bar. Two months later, i made more money than i have ever made in more whole life.
                i wouldn't have belived cashgod if it didn't come from a trusted source

because it was too good to be
                true. If it wasn't for my guts, i'll still be a frustrated broke
                college graduate. sometimes we need to take a bold step to see the light.

       I visited the homeless yesterday and spent over $3,000. It was a way for me

to give out.
                most people here just blow their money away on drugs, materialistic

bullshits and hoes.
                Don't take this opportunity for granted and think it will last forever,

because you
                might want to place an order one day and be told that they don't sell cash

anymore.
                be wise, save, invest, give out to the less priviledged, get a job and live

a decent life.
                I'm worth over $500,000 now and i got 90% of it from cashgod. I would have

blown every
                package i ever bought away just like most of you do becasue you didn't work

for the money, but instead
                of that, i choose to save and invest every package. see this as a friendly

advice, think about the
                future.

                i actually thought i'll loose my money when i ordered for the pro package.
                i'm going for the v.i.p next.

       I placed my order and didn't receive any email from Brad or any of the buy

cash team.
                I honestly thought i was scammed, but after two days i got an email with my

tracking number
                and an apology from Brad saying that they have been super busy handling

the tons of orders they got.
                I don't give a fuck wanye, please don't waste my time next time.

       The goal is to smile to the bank every month with $30,000. $30,000 * 12 =

$360,000.
                i'll be making more money than most people in america even after tax.

       I was anxious when i received the package, i thought cashgod was the Feds

trying to capture criminals on

                    darknet by offering them huge ammount of money at an affordable price.

But i was just too high on
                    THC.

       my wife thought i robbed the bank when she worked in on me unboxing $30,000

with anxiety.
                she asked me where i got the huge sum of money from as she looked at me

straight in my eyes. I could
                not lie,
                so i had to say the truth. I told her i bought the money from the darknet

and to my greatest surprise,
                she has never
                heard of the darknet. I then told her to search about it using the

internet, but she has to be careful
                enough
                not to use google, rather she should use duckduckgo so that our ip address

won't be related to any
                search about
                the darknet. After hours of her reading about the darknet and accessing the

cashgod website, she
                believed me
                and then told me she wants to be a part of it. she has placed her first

order, and i'm still waiting to
                place another
                as soon as possible. We both hope this won't end anytime soon.

       I'm done working 9 to 5. stumbling on cashgod is a miracle, because i never

knew such thing exist in
                this life.
                I grew up being trapped mentally on the earth surface. Now i have realized

the power of curiosity.

       <br/>
       Happy new year to our beloved customers.
                you guys are among the brave ones that were able
                to leverage our services and become financially free.
                Things will eventually be different this year, and we wont't be
                going anywhere anytime soon. We are right here for you guys, and together
                we are one and stronger than we have ever been before.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       We made few changes :
       <br/>
       <br/>
       1: We now ship to cuba.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       2: We reduced our prices so that it can be affordable for the less

priviledged
       <br/>
       <br/>
       3: We now offer the V.I.P package to people willing to pay. You don't

need to purchase ten packages
                to
                be eligible for a V.I.P package.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       -(V.I.P packages now range from $500,000 to $2,000,000.)
       <br/>
       <br/>
       4: We no longer convert V.I.P packages to currencies such as EURO and

Pounds, we only sell in
                dollars.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       5: You get to buy only once in a month.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       More changes might be coming soon, changes that will benefit both our

customers and us.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You can start placing your order.
       <br/>

                    cash for us veterans to buy.

       ITS
                    LEGIT! I came home yesterday and opened it up. Cash is in there and it
                    is the real deal. Unfortunately I didn’t get extra like some other
                    people did.. But I got what I ordered and I am happy with that.

                    you're warped idea of ''Justice'' and fuck off. I hope the dudes covered

       I've
                    already been scammed by one of these sites. I placed my order on this
                    website for a Basic package on May 27th @ 2 PM. I emailed them asking
                    for an update on my order as I'm being very cautious and skeptical right
                    now. No reply as of yet, but I will let all of you know if I ever hear
                    anything back. Otherwise, they took my bitcoin and ran like the other
                    scam site.

       I
                    was scammed from another site that sold euros and then found they copy
                    this site. I ordered Silver package with delivery to Germany. Package
                    came in a computer company box hidden in grey bags. Less than 4 days
                    passed from payment to delivery by post.

       I
                    agree Diablox32. Having worked in the banking industry for years now,
                    I’ve seen scores of money making methods come and go. Until now, nobody
                    quite got it right and everyone was trying to fuck you over. In the
                    cashgod method, they have created a near perfect blend of ease and
                    security. I’ve been using them for months now – keep it up!

       Man,
                    I have been reading some of these reviews and you fuckers that are
                    complaining about anything at all should just shut the fuck up or leave
                    this world completely. You really want to complain that you big ass box
                    of cash was $20, $50, or even $100 short?? So fucking what!!!! You still
                    have a shitload more than you had before the packaged arrived so why
                    are you even looking a gift horse in the mouth? Assholes!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Oh and
                    your package took one day longer to ship or two days longer to receive?
                    Again, so fucking what! At least you got the package and didn’t get
                    scammed like you thought you would! If I was Brad I would stop shipping
                    to any asshole that complained, left a bad review, or just flat out was
                    an asshole to him because you hate your life and feel the need to bring
                    everyone down with you. Better be glad it’s not me shipping the stuff
                    or half you mother fuckers would be cut off completely AND I would still
                    keep your BTC to show you how life isn’t fair and you can’t expect it
                    to be just cause you live in your own head.

      <p>
       I
                    am seriously concerned about our government. I think the Swiss is going
                    to experience a coup and if does the currency markets are going to go
                    to shit. Bitcoin and Gold will be the best resource.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I could give
                    2 shits that I am stealing money from the gov buying preshred. I dont
                    even see it as stealing. I paid thousands of dollars in taxes and all
                    our gov does is give it to special interest groups.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I am taking
                    my money back from the Swiss government and they can fuck themselves
                    while I spend my reclaimed cash the way I want too.
       <br/>
       Keep up the good work cashgod!

       Hey
                    c0mm@n3r you make a good point. I also have gotten screwed by a couple
                    of sellers on locabitcoins. They take a steep profit for themselves and I
                    payfor it. I started moving my coin though Brad as an alternative and
                    it was a good choice. Though every time I get a package from him I still
                    check the money for counterfeit. So far no found to date.

                    same time.

                    was exactly what I ordered. Saturday delivery too! Thank you!

                    cash shortage. Brad said that its looking like they will probably will
                    run out by thurs/fri. Glad I got my order in.

       @Bmood – That is a good question.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       It
                    works like this – We take our preshred CHF and send them to a contact
                    we have in Luxembourg who then takes the cash and exchanges it for
                    Euros. This is why Euro, GBP and USD have a higher cost than CHF, we
                    have to pay our people to make the exchange.
       <br/>

       placed
                    my order and got a tracking confirmation 10 hours later. kind of slow
                    response time right? followed the tracking until it showed up today. I
                    ordered the $6,650 package and he gave me $6,950 which is nice. “Brad”
                    with cashgod makes lots of stupid jokes but i got my cash. he can
                    keep his jokes to himself in the future. just keep sending me the money
                    and shut the hell up

       It
                    has been a busy past week or two especially with all the fuckery going
                    on with the hijacked link. Always be vigilant and make sure the onion
                    address you are on matches the pictures and remember we ONLY USE
                    cashgod@protonmail.com
       <br/>
       <br/>
       We are asking again for recent clients
                    to please send us some pics of your shipments so that we can use them on
                    our website. We get questions all the time from people asking for pics,
                    what better pics to show than the actual product itself at its
                    destination. Send them to our email and make sure you have removed all
                    metadata and that they do not identify you or show something that would
                    identify you. If your pic is attached to a new order, you will get 50%
                    off that order with free overnight shipping. if you send us some bull
                    shit you wont get anything. Dont send a dick pic and ask for 50%.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       As
                    always around a holiday USD inventory runs low. If you are getting
                    regular monthly shipments those will not be impacted. If you are
                    ordering do so now to ensure your order is filled. Euro and GBP
                    inventory should be good for the next few days.

       Late
                    this afternoon my order from cashgod arrived. Upon inspection of
                    the parcel was 2 sealed silver bags which contained 6,650 British Pound
                    Sterling. The notes where then checked for counterfeit using a Safescan
                    2985-SX with all bills passing inspection.

       This
                    was my first purchase with cashgod. I bought the standard $6,650
                    package. Since it was my first transaction I used escrow (CoinMixer
                    Escrow Service).
       <br/>
       Process went smoothly from the time of order and
                    deposit with escrow company. It took 12 days to receive the cash. Cash
                    was in 20s, 50s, and 100s . Packaging was secure and cash well hidden.
       <br/>
       I will be ordering again.
       <br/>
       Thank you.

       I spent almost $10,000 in cash last night and had the time of my life.
       <br/>
       I
                    didnt even go to bed yet. I had to post before I crash. cashgod is
                    awesome. I had my first threesome with 2 really hot strippers, rented a
                    stretched limo, and had my own VIP table service at a real popular club.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I
                    could do this every night. Brad I hope you dont run out of cash. I am
                    living like a king. I think I am going to download the pic of Leo from
                    your home page and make it my logo for life.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Now Im going to pass out. Good Night.

       OK Brad its been a month since I received my last order. I am putting in for my second order. This time I am
                    going for $45,000.

       Will I still get my cash like last time within 2-3 days?

       In

                    some are not. The Euro from cashgod is real (confirmed) and I have
                    no problems with the post in Germany.

       Look,
                    everything has its pros and cons. I am a Master with Brad. Which
                    basically means I have bought a shit ton of cash. The pros of this site.
                    It delivers real cash. Brad uses good stealth for the shipping. The
                    cons-you can only order once a month. Some bullshit about making sure
                    there is enough cash for everyone. If it were up to me I would just by
                    it all and fuck the rest of you. But no, I have to buy every month like
                    everyone else.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       If you are still on the fence. Dont do it!! You are not ready for this lifestyle. Plus it
                    means more cash for me.

       cashgod is highly professional, knowledgeable about this work and
                    deadline focused. The cash delivery was on time and they are easy to
                    work with. I think he could improve on responding to messages faster. I
                    will definitely order with cashgod in the future. Only good things
                    to say!

                    later this week.

       I
                    had a $100 bill that wasn’t going through the ATM. I asked if they
                    would replace it. I was told “cashgod is not currently accepting
                    bull shit from faggots like you”. I’m very upset. I demand more respect
                    than that. All the other cash spent fantastic.

                    just dropping a line to say thank you. I am glad I went ahead with the
                    semi pro as my first order. I can get a lot done with it. You will be
                    hearing from me again in exactly a month when I get set to me a “Pro”
                    😉

       Please
                    make sure you bookmark cashgodplzcfmasy.onion. We are aware of a hijack
                    from our site to another using a @secmail.pro email address. People
                    with good eyes noticed that the onion address in the pictures was ours
                    but the address of the site was different. We are working on it.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       As
                    most of you are existing clients this may not be so much of an issue
                    but note we did NOT change our email. Please keep your correspondence
                    with
       <a href="mailto:cashgod@protonmail.com">
        cashgod@protonmail.com
       </a>
       .
       <br/>
       <br/>
       We
                    have made major changes to the website. These include security measures
                    and customer service changes, which are reflected in the ordering
                    process.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       1. The comment form now has a captcha because we noticed an increasing number of hacking attempts.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       2.
                    Because there are still too many idiots who can not follow simple
                    instructions, we have integrated an ordering process on our site, to
                    keep things even more simple. Nothing changes for our monthly
                    subscribers. You will get your package as usual.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       For all new
                    customers there is now the possibility to place their order directly via
                    the website. For the hacker aka script-kiddies: go fuck yourself - we
                    arn't amateurs, we are unhackable!

       I
                    wanted to take a min and thank Brad. I ordered from that scam site
                    with the secmail.pro email address. The site look just like this one but
                    I didnt notice the onion address and the pictures were not the same.
                    Well I was screwed.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I told Brad what had happened and asked if
                    this was a scam to please not take my money. I bought the 6,650 and it
                    actually arrived. Brad even threw in 2,000 extra which more than
                    covered what I lost at the scam site with the secmail.pro email address.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Thank you Brad. People Need to
                    Know.

       Be
                    careful!!! Like some others that commented here I was scammed by a
                    clone as well. cashgod is pretty famous in the underground world but
                    as a noob I didnt know any better. Hint: notice the real cashgod
                    onion address is in the pictures.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Brad and his team are
                    fantastic. They helped me overcome my fear and distrust since getting
                    screwed twice before with cloned sites. I did my homework this time and
                    researched with TRUSTED darkweb veterans who know what is what around
                    here and the gave me the correct cashgodplzcfmasy.onion cashgod
                    address. I have made sure to keep this link bookmarked so that I am not
                    fooled again. There are so many clones out their its hard to know what
                    is real or not. All I can tell you is do your research (which is hard)
                    with people who REALLY KNOW the darkweb. Its not as easy as it seems.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       BTW..
                    the money you get from these guys is not counterfeit. It is real cash,
                    like others I tested it for counterfeit and used a pro grade counter,
                    every bill passed and as others have commented their stealth shipping is
                    insane!

       I
                    believe that BTC is about to go up so I bought preshred to use to buy
                    bitcoin bitcoin. Its nice because I get preshred at a big discount which
                    translates to discounted bitcoin. Once I sell after a nice pop up I
                    will turn a really good profit. Fingers crossed.

      <p>
       My
                    biggest issue about this place is it is hard to find. There are so many
                    scam sites that copied cashgod and it makes it hard to find this
                    one. I know that is not their fault, but it is frustrating.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The
                    product itself is great. The currency is real and I can spend it very
                    easily. I have not had a problem yet. This is my third order with my
                    latest for a standard. What i really like is how well they hide the
                    contents of the shipment. Out of 3 orders each was different. I wont
                    type them as I am not sure they would want that information public.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Overall
                    if you are looking for a cheap source for cash this is the place. I
                    know they do not like posting onion addresses but I would think their
                    own is permitted. Bookmark this site cashgodplzcfmasy.onion and save
                    yourself the hassle of trying to find it every time.

       I
                    went to sint maartin using the pre shred cash and I cant be any
                    happier. I paid for my air, hotel, casino trips, and yes, to the whore
                    house, which I highly recommend. The most beautiful Colombian girls in
                    the world and compared to nevada they are cheap but high quality.
                    $10,000 goes a long way.

       This
                    was my first transaction using a TOR browser. I was very nervous. I
                    placed my order for a $1300 on Friday the 4th of May. I sent the bitcoin
                    to Brad to a wallet address he provided. After 3 or so hours I got a
                    shipping confirmation and tracking number stating my package would
                    arrived 14th of May. BTW I used the free shipping option. The package
                    arrived this morning via USPS. The envelope was a generic USPS envelope
                    and was sealed. Inside the envelope was a shrink wrapped DVD and a paid
                    invoice for $19.95 for the DVD. At this point I thought I received the
                    wrong piece of mail. I opened the DVD and inside was a sealed black bag.
                    I used some scissors and cut the top of the bag open. Inside was $1300
                    in various bills. Most of the bills were in fairly good condition.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I
                    know people are probably looking at this site and wondering whether or
                    not to order. I was one of those people. Overall I am please with the
                    transaction and would do another order with them.

       I used to work with counterfeit currency, but now with cashgod I can get the real stuff minus the risk.

       I
                    might be in the minority, but I hope people were scared off by the hack
                    and stay away from here. The less people who know about it the more
                    cash that’s available for me to order.

                    just waiting on the product. I’ll follow up in a few days to let you all

       QUESTION
       <br/>
       Hey Brad and the community , just have a question,
       <br/>
       I live in France just across border of
                    Switzerland.
       <br/>
       Do you think I can change Euro cash to Swiss francs at the Currency exchange office.
       <br/>
       For
                    example changing 500 Euro (max) to Swiss francs (for not getting attention).
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Thanks

       I
                    previously posted but it may not have gone through due to the hack. I
                    ordered day before yesterday, requested overnight and BTC prices rose so
                    I only had enough in my wallet to buy standard delivery once I was
                    contacted. I used the
       <a class="reply" href="mailto:cashgod@protonmail.com">
        cashgod@protonmail.com
       </a>
       email and got instructions. I looked at the shipment schedule and it
                    looks like a standard shipment wont ship until Monday since standard
                    will not ship today correct? Thanks.

       That is correct shipments do not go out on Sunday. All orders will go out on Monday. Back to business as normal.

       Blackhat check your email….. You should be all set. We added extra cash that should cover you and then some.

       <br/>
       The
                    hack has been resolved for now. As you know in the dark net this is
                    normal business and goes with the territory. Be careful when you order
                    or communicate with us and always use
       <a href="mailto:cashgod@protonmail.com">
        cashgod@protonmail.com
       </a>
       .
                    Capital letters or mix of capital and lower case letters are the same thing. As long as it is
       <a href="mailto:cashgod@protonmail.com">
        cashgod@protonmail.com
       </a>
       you are fine. Always make sure the onion in the picture matches the
                    onion for the site you are on. The hackers used a site that looked like
                    ours with a similar onion address but not the same. The pictures had our
                    onion in them, they didnt change them, but their onion was very similar
                    so if you didnt pay attention you might not have noticed. We are
                    working on making some major changes to the site coming up to reduce
                    things like this and make it a little easier for our clients to
                    recognize if they are on a scam site or not. However, technology being
                    what it is, it is not fool proof and it will eventually be overcome. Its
                    just the way things are.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       We are operating normally now. Feel
                    free to claim your cash. Dont let hackers stop you. Its what they want
                    to do anyway. We wont be deterred neither should you.

       Greetings Ladies &amp; Gentleman
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Please note that we only use
       <a href="mailto:cashgod@protonmail.com">
        cashgod@protonmail.com
       </a>
       to process orders. We DO NOT use @secmail.pro, @gmail.com, or any
                    other. It is always cashgod NOT cashgod2 or anything else. Those
                    are clones. A special thanks to one of our regular clients who noticed a
                    hack that was routing people to another site. However with keen eyes he
                    saw that the onion address and the onion in the pictures did not match.
                    This issue has been corrected. He is going to be well compensated for
                    his assistance.

       Hey All,
       <br/>
       I
                    was *highly* skeptical. In fact I thought cashgod was selling high
                    quality counterfeit and saying it was real cash. I placed my order on
                    Thursday morning with 2-3 day shipping, tracking received Thursday
                    night, package received today. This is not counterfeit, it’s 100%
                    genuine and I took it to the bank. I see good reviews and I am going to
                    add my voice to theirs. I will be definitely getting 10,000k next time
                    round.
       <br/>
       May you all enjoy your cash in health and prosperity,
       <br/>
       Pink

       I
                    have been a long time client with Brad. He is a good man and really
                    does not need to do this. I think he sells this cash so that every hard
                    working person has the opportunity to be free from debt and bill
                    collectors. Thats just my opinion.
       <br/>
       BTW Brad the new guy is doing a
                    good job. My latest package had everything packaged professionally. I
                    was surprised he got $10,000 in such a small space.

       I
                    tried these guys out with a test order – Basic – early last week. When
                    I sent the email to order I received a reply within 5 hours with
                    payment instructions. I paid using BTC and within another 3 hours I
                    received tracking information. The order took 7 days to arrive via
                    Fedex. The packaging was a Fedex box and inside were 2 DVD’s and an
                    invoice for them totaling $22. When I opened the DVD’s there was cash
                    inside. I tested the bills using a pen and each bill passed. The bills
                    are VERY used but they are real.

      <p>
       FYI
                    to our GBP buyers we have some high value orders to process which will
                    lower our inventory and may fully deplete it. We will know in the next
                    24 hours if those orders follow through.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I get a lot of questions
                    as to why I do not respond to each post…. Answer… It takes too much
                    time. When we were smaller that was easier to do, now not so much.
                    However let me address some questions:
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Is the USD, Euro, GBP
                    counterfeit. Again, this question should be easy to answer for yourself
                    if you have read our website. The answer is NO it is genuine currency
                    that can be used or deposited in the bank. Again, do not deposit more
                    than 10,000 into an account within a 24 hour period. In the USA I would
                    recommend it being less than $9,000 now. Too many people are depositing
                    $9,900 to avoid reporting. The best advice is to spend the cash if you
                    can. Stay away from banks and credit cards. They are evil entities
                    looking to drain you and your family. Get yourself on a cash budget.
                    That way what you spend your money on is your business.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Another
                    popular question …. Is this real? Can you prove it? What do I need to do
                    to order? First, how the fuck do we respond to the first two questions?
                    Think about the logic in that for just a second. NOTHING can be proven
                    on the dark net. Period. Nothing. Reviews and comments are bullshit
                    anywhere. Anyone can post, Anywhere, Anytime. If you get false
                    confidence in people who you do not know telling you its ok. Then you
                    need to reassess yourself. Unfortunately, there are scams out there. Its
                    the cost of doing business on the dark net. High Risk = High Reward. We
                    are doing our best to track down people who clone our site through
                    convert measures in our code. However, it is not always 100%. Plus if
                    you find a site through a 3rd party advertiser on the clear net it is
                    most likely a fake or Law Enforcement setting a trap. Only use THW
       <a href="http://cashgodplzcfmasy.onion/">
        http://cashgodplzcfmasy.onion
       </a>
       .
                    Again being the darknet there are lots of scam THW but if you look you
                    will see reputable VPN providers who show this link as a starting point
                    for new users to the dark net. It is the ONLY 3rd party site we are on.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Do
                    not send us emails asking how do I order or what is the next step? Its a
                    waste of time. The ordering directions are clear on the site. Follow
                    them and their will be no problems.

                    took much time and energy, plus they lower the inventory.

                    I kept buying bitcoin when it dropped in the low 6,000’s using the cash
                    you shipped me. Now it has jumped in price. I have stopped my carding
                    business and now buy from you exclusively. I say to anyone waiting,
                    stop, and start ordering now. You can only get cash every couple of
                    weeks, but it adds up fast.

       Scam
                    sites are doing that shit all the time. The best ones are like the one
                    you posted. They dont even bother to change the pictures or anything. It
                    is clear as day that its fake. The onion address in the picture doesnt
                    match their website. Its a good catch though.

                    days. Brad I hope your “new” staff members are better than the last
                    crew. Your product is great but when I pay for overnight I expect
                    overnight.

                    some of my loses.

       <br/>
       THW
                    (The Hidden Wiki) is a good source for legit DW links. There are others
                    out their too, but THW is good starting point and it is well trusted
                    and respected in the community. Be careful on the DW. Brad was right
                    about not going to sites that advertise on the CW (Google, youtube,
                    etc). They are either scams or law enforcement. Another good way is ask
                    for a ridiculous amount of whatever they are selling. If they are
                    willing to sell you then its probably a scam. For example, I was told
                    about a site selling cheap molly. I told him I was a big dealer and
                    needed 10,000 pills overnight and I was willing to pay extra for the
                    delivery. No hesitation, the guy replies with payment info. I knew it
                    was bull shit.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       When I was first introduced to Brad I did the
                    same thing and asked for 1 million. Guess what? He told me no and told
                    the rules we all here over and over. I bought my first 10k and never
                    looked back. I buy ever 2-3 weeks. I would buy more, but like everyone
                    else, I am not allowed too.

       <br/>
       My
                    bitch dumped me for some fucker with a trendy haircut and jeans with a
                    logo on the pocket. I’m been pissed about it like a monkey with with a
                    pine-cone up its butt. I came to the darknet to post all the naked
                    pictures I have of her for revenge, isn’t there a website you can do
                    that? I couldnt find that website but I found cashgod.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I’ve
                    been ordering a lot of cash and living like a fucking rap star. So get
                    this brotha’s she comes back to me because everyone know’s I have tons
                    of money now. She wanted to get back together. fuck that I told her, I
                    told her that I have enough money to get a woman with a nice ass and
                    better tits than hers. Nice huh? I offered her $1,000 to let me fuck her
                    one last time but she said no. bitch doesnt know what’s good for her.

       I’ve
                    ordered alot of cash from Brad over the past few months. I really look
                    up to the guy, he’s like the criminal father I never had. So I
                    submitted recordings of my classical piano music to him and he told me
                    to “fuck that, music is for retards and blind Negros” I thought Brad
                    was a class act, but I guess he’s just the guy to ask for Cash. Not
                    interested in the finer things in life.

       No
                    idea why, but my last comment didn’t post, lets see if this one does!
                    Ordered on the 25th (only small 1k package to test the water) but
                    haven’t had any tracking or anything at all really. Just not sure how
                    this works with it being a first order ( of many to come ) from RC. This
                    isn’t a negative post because it does say delivery 3-4 days and im in
                    the UK. Will post once it arrives or doesn’t. I’m just wanting to
                    receive my first order to see its legit, then onto the big bucks orders!

       We
                    have made some “staffing” changes to improve on turnaround time. Plus,
                    we had a couple of dip shits who were taking cash for themselves.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Also,
                    if you are too timid to make an order and follow through then don’t
                    order. We are not taking pictures for you. If we did that for every
                    order that comes in we would never accomplish anything. For those of you
                    who did get customized pictures, that will not be happening again. We
                    have too much business and this isn’t fucking Amazon.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       For those
                    of you who are new to the dark web, if you find advertising for a dark
                    net sight in a search engine like google, bing, yahoo, duckduckgo, etc
                    then most likely its bull shit. Save your money. Legit dark web vendors
                    largely do business by word of mouth and or have been vetted by long
                    time trusted dark web sites.

       I am a regular customer here and now get regular shipments every month. It has changed my life.
       <br/>
       The
                    real scammers are the government. Many countries used to be on the gold
                    standard. Meaning for every dollar printed the government held one
                    dollar worth of gold in its reserve. Now the government doesn’t use that
                    standard and they just print money with nothing backing it. A dollar
                    bill is worth a dollar only because the government says it is.
       <br/>
       Guys
                    like cashgod are fucking around with their system. I am sure they
                    are going after them with everything they got with fake reviews and DOS
                    attacks etc. Of course they cant find them via tor so they do the next
                    best thing and try to scare people into not buying the pre shred cash.
       <br/>
       Look
                    people the government has fucked us over and big banks and greedy
                    politicians have taken over by tweaking the system in their favor. The
                    team at cashgod has evened the score and let us have our money back.
                    The money belongs to the people. Plus, you could make much better use
                    of the money than your government.
       <br/>
       Just my two micro bits for what its worth.

       cashgod was the first purchase I ever made on the dark web. I am glad I
                    did it. Of course that gave me the confidence to order other things from
                    other vendors and I got screwed. Go figure.
       <br/>
       cashgod has been fantastic. Keep up the fight Brad we need you!

                    had even a twinge of interest in extra cash and breaking free of the
                    rat race, I highly recommend you order this product. cashgod is very
                    generous with their service. BRAVA, cashgod. Outta the park!

                    We use cashgod to launder our bitcoin to cash. Its better than
                    using LBC and we get real cash in return. If you are involved in
                    “nontraditional” lines of business this is a excellent resource for your
                    cash management.

       <br/>
       We
                    have updated our inventory across the board, which is a good thing
                    since we were running low. We have had another record week, for what
                    reason, I have no clue. We are getting a number of special requests for
                    low denominations for high level packages. We will do our best to fill
                    them but you may get higher denominated bills to fill the balance. We
                    only have a finite number of smaller bills. Plus we do not want to add
                    unnecessary volume to the packages.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Again, for the millionth
                    time, read the directions before you order. If you dont follow the
                    directions we are not filling your order.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       There are some
                    ingenious methods of how people are using their pre shred cash. If you
                    care to share your methods please do. Thank you to The Banker and those
                    who have already done so. Remember, the only person who can change your
                    life is you! The possibilities are endless.

       I
                    love the service here. I started loaning out my preshreded cash to
                    people with a 20% fee and business is fantastic. I use the cash that
                    comes into the packages that why I never need to deposit it. I pay a
                    couple of guys to handle “enforcement’ for me. It has been a gold mine.

       This
                    is one of the better sites on the dark web. The ordering process was
                    straight forward and delivery was prompt. My only complaint would be
                    with post ordering communication since it takes them a bit to respond.
                    The cash is good and spends as described.

       Advice
                    to all men out there. Ya’ll wonder if you dick is big enough. As a
                    woman, and knowing lots of women I have this to say… Your penis size
                    does not matter. Women want a man with money. I know that sounds shallow
                    but they want to know you can provide for them. Love fades really fast
                    if you have to eat rice and beans every night. Buy from cashgod and
                    get yourself a woman.

       The
                    more I watch the news the more I realize that the entire political
                    system is a joke and we are the punchline. I am stocking up on cash now
                    because the stock market is about to take a giant dump. The markets hate
                    chaos. I am going to keep taking advantage of your services here until I
                    can retire.

       Anyone
                    know how to get my wife to stop calling me a pussy? I tell her “please
                    dont call me that, cant you see i’m crying?” but she just keeps yelling
                    and I cant stop crying.
       <br/>
       If I didnt get orders in the mail from cashgod she would yell more.

       I
                    agree. Its all screwed up. I watch all the political things going on
                    and they are spending BIG money, trillions of dollars. I dont feel bad
                    either. What cashgod is doing is just a drop in the bucket.

       Hell yeah, if cashgod is real, I don’t mind to order from him
                    because his cash is made from the reptilians.

       I
                    was one of those that got scammed by one of the clones. They had a
                    facebook page. I should have know better that true criminals would not
                    be advertising or have a portal through facebook. Lesson learned.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       However
                    Brad was a true gent and added the cash I lost when I ordered the
                    standard. There are not many guys out there who would do that for their
                    customers, even when it was the customers fault for being stupid. Thanks
                    Brad. I will recommend you to everyone I know.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       BTW….for those
                    of you out there dont believe reviews on reddit or anywhere else. They
                    are bullshit and it was how I got fucked in the first place.

       this

                    package I am hooked and buy as much as I can every time. cashgod
                    takes 2+ days to ship sometimes longer so buy as much as you can. I also
                    think their going to get busted at some point. They also make you wait 1
                    month to order again. Booooooo!

       The
                    politicians are put there to give you the idea you have freedom of
                    choice. You don’t. You have no choice. You have owners. They own you.
                    They own everything. They own all the important land, they own and
                    control the corporations that’ve long since bought and paid for, the
                    senate, the congress, the state houses, the city halls, they got the
                    judges in their back pocket, and they own all the big media companies so
                    they control just about all of the news and the information you get to
                    hear. They got you by the balls. They spend billions of dollars every
                    year lobbying to get what they want. Well, we know what they want. They
                    want more for themselves and less for everybody else. But I’ll tell you
                    what they don’t want. They don’t want you ruining the economy by buying
                    stolen cash from “cashgod”. This is real but buy at your own risk of
                    disturbing the owners of this world.

       I
                    am a US expat living in Mexico. I have done a few orders with cashgod and shipping to Mexico was never an issue. I have a dollar
                    denominated account but I deposit the cash and had no issues.
       <br/>
       I dont believe cashgod has pesos but you
                    should have no problems exchanging the pre shred dollars for pesos at the bank.

       <br/>
       We
                    are finishing final shipments from over the weekend. There was a delay
                    and those of you impacted will be compensated for the extra time.
                    However all tracking numbers should be out. As you can imagine, we were
                    hit hard over the past few days with last minute orders for arrival by
                    Tuesday. Those in the USA have an extra day ( you know what I mean).
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Make
                    sure you pay attention to your quote amount including the decimal and
                    the number of zeros. If you cant do that, do not order. You need to
                    understand basic math and follow directions.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Prices may be going
                    up soon. We will not be announcing in advance when that will happen. Get
                    your orders in as soon as possible if you want to take advantage of the
                    lower rates. Once they increase we will not honor old pricing.

       Mr.
                    Brad good job on our most recent order to Hong Kong. Delivery was
                    prompt and your stealth packaging works. I will be ordering again soon.

       I
                    have a message from Brad with the tracking number. Wednesday is the
                    day!! This is my second order. I tested it out with $1000 with
                    overnight. The magazine with the cash inside showed up next day. Now I
                    bought the $45,000. This is almost a years salary coming on Tuesday. I
                    feel like a teenager with a new girlfriend.

       Now
                    days I just sit on my couch and watch TV. I pay cleaners to clean my
                    apartment. I order fast food for every meal. I literally don’t do a damn
                    thing except eat, watch TV and sleep. Thank you Brad for helping me
                    get to the American Dream of doing nothing.

       Thank
                    you cashgod! My package arrived just in time for my Las Vegas trip.
                    Now I have plenty of spending money. Fingers crossed I can turn 10k
                    into 100k !!!
       <br/>
       If you are unsure about cashgod... Do it! I sat around for months I wish I started earlier. I
                    know its scary but wow!

       Ordered
                    my first package on the 15th. Had issues with emails being returned
                    when I sent my transaction number which made me a bit nervous. However, I
                    noticed that the java script has to be enabled for the proton mail to
                    work. This is disabled when on the highest security setting. I dropped
                    mine to safer or about the middle just long enough to send the message.
                    Think it went through now. For those of you that have problems with
                    emails timing out when sending, you might try this.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Anyway,
                    looking forward to getting a tracking number the weekend slowed my
                    process. Also, when it is day here it is night there so I have to
                    account for time differences in working hours. Here is keeping my
                    fingers crossed that I will receive my order and then I will make a
                    bigger purchase.

      Special Agent Sean Keith - Federal Bureau of Investigation -- Financial Crimes Division
      <br/>
      April
                14, 2019 at 8:33 pm
      <br/>
      <p>
       My
                    opposition and my plea for users to steer clear is rooted only in the
                    fact the website’s operators are reptilian and anti-human. They come
                    many light-years away from Earth and settle on our planet to cause
                    financial chaos and to destroy the human race.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       After careful
                    studying of our prior investigations, I can now say with great
                    confidence that the operators behind this website “cashgod” were
                    accessory to the orchestraters of the 2008 depression. They knew about
                    it beforehand and assisted in the financial ruin. These website
                    operators are key players in the reptilian agenda, and while I wish to
                    capture them, these reptilian entities continue to elude us since the
                    beginning of mankind and my efforts would be futile. They possess
                    ability to “teleport” and various more other-worldly mechanisms and
                    tools to avoid detection.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       So while the Agency is aware that if we
                    do have a lead on “cashgod,” they will employ highly-advanced
                    reptilian technology and avoid detection.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I want to stress to the
                    website users, the money is real. Bank tellers and ATMs will accept it
                    as genuine cash. But you are buying it from reptilians and anti-human
                    entities who seek to destroy the world. Is free money worth selling your
                    soul to the devil?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Think about that for a minute.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       My name is Special Agent Sean and this is my

       Is
                    it possiable to setup an arrangement using your organization as a
                    payment processor. We instruct our clients to pay to your crypto address
                    and you in tern send us the pre shreded cash? Could we include a code
                    word with each “order” so that you know the address to send the cash?
       <br/>
       We may have times we order more than
                    $50k? What happens in that situation?

       I
                    was really skeptical this was all bullshit but I did it anyway. I am
                    glad I went through it. After a couple of back and forth emails with
                    Brad I ordered the standard. 6 days later it came in. There was an
                    extra $120 inside too which was a nice surprise.

       I needed a car and used cashgod to make it happen. I did my research before I did anything and it worked
                    out.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Here is what I learned:
       <br/>
       <br/>
       1. I bought the standard ($6,650)
       <br/>
       2. Ask for large bills.
       <br/>
       3. Buy
                    your car (used) at auction.
       <br/>
       4. Make sure the out the door price is less than $6,650
       <br/>
       5. Per IRS guidelines
                    any transaction in cash $10,000 or higher has to be reported.
       <br/>
       6. I paid $5,700 for my car after fees and taxes.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I
                    know its not as glorious as to what some other people are doing here
                    but I did get a good deal. I paid $1000 to buy the standard package and ended up
                    with a car that’s worth about $7,000 if I sold it to a private seller.

       Hello My Friends
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Last
                    week was very busy. Many orders from the USA looking for cash before
                    IRS deadline of 17 April. Lots of people asking for overnight. Needless
                    to say, shits been crazy around here. I am adjusting our volume levels
                    for USD to medium. If you are looking to buy and get your cash before 17
                    April you need to order now! We will only fill orders on a first come
                    first served basis. If we do not respond to your order request it means
                    we can not fill it due to inventory. We expect more cash arriving in the
                    next few days. When that happens I will get you know.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       We are
                    still getting order requests that do not include shipping addresses. We
                    had one dumb fuck yesterday that was upset that his package did not come
                    overnight, but he never sent the address. We sent 4 emails. He changed
                    his email address. That is NOT our problem. You are responsible to make
                    sure you include all the proper information and are following our
                    ordering instructions. Its pretty simple, many people do it and get
                    their cash quickly. You can too, just follow the directions.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Spend Wisely My Friends

                    didnt want kids and its my job to stay home, have kids and clean. I also
                    had a guy tell me “Once your done working here, you can come over to my
                    place and do some real work” LOL

       fraudulent,
                    cashgod is stealing from the Swiss government. Do not buy stolen
                    money like this! Its not traceable but its not yours either.

       Brad,
                    long time buyer here… why do people not read the fuckin site. You know
                    they dont when they ask stupid questions like is the money counterfeit
                    or not.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You should make this a private club and not open to the public. I agree that not everyone deserves
                    to have money.

       For

                    going to be stolen from my front door. Luckily I nothing happened and
                    the first order arrived but I cant go through all the anxiety again. I
                    know its been less than a week but can I order again? Can we meet at the
                    mall?

       I got the Basic and it arrived inside 2 DVDs. Now I own Ghostbusters and Ghostbusters 2. Though Ghostbusters 2
                    kind of sucks.

       My
                    “Tax Refund” arrived today. I am very happy with my purchase here. I
                    will wait the required month before I place another order.

                    received as agreed. We will do more transactions. You are the best
                    source for money in Europe.

       I

                    response after payment and no tracking number. Luckily it showed up
                    yesterday. It is exactly was they say it is, but communication could be a
                    bit better. I will buy again but I wont expect any hand holding.

                    will arrive on Friday.

       The
                    process is fairly simple but too many people get greedy. Keeping
                    deposits under $10,000 and spread out will keep you safe. I paid off
                    $50,000 in credit card debt.

       ANNOUNCEMENT!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Hello Girls and Fellas,
       <br/>
       <br/>
       We made profound changes to our site.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       From
                    a six-package system, we switched to a three-package system. We also
                    have Bitcoin live exchange rates built in. These are updated every 24
                    hours.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       We made these changes because we've seen more difficulties
                    with our clientele and as we get more and more monthly buyers, we
                    wanted to simplify the process for everyone. An order can now be made
                    with a single email. Read the steps below the packages. Everything is
                    explained there.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       For our permanent customers everything stays the same.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Another
                    important note: please make sure you are on the right page. Check the
                    URL in the header-image with the one in your browser address field.
       <br/>

       Hey
                    titsup I agree noobs do some stupid shit. Most have never visited onion
                    land and have no idea what they are doing. I was reading in the paper
                    today some dumb ass posted info about how he bought stuff on the dark
                    net and posted it on youtube. Guess who showed up at his front door? You
                    guessed it the friendly men in blue. Why people post anything about
                    dark net activities on the clear net is something I will never
                    understand. Google and other companies hand info off to the NSA and Feds
                    all the time.

                    taking trips in planes that cost 25k per hour, this IS NOT STEALING,

       TRUMP
                    SUCKS !!! I voted for him. I thought he was going to clean shit up.
                    Nope he is just like the rest. He signed the fucking spending bill and
                    no one has read it and the Dems loaded it with bullshit.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Looks
                    like all politicians are the same. Our national debt is going to keep
                    going up and no one is going to be able to pay it making our dollar
                    worthless. Unfortunately I need our toilet paper of a currency to pay
                    bills. So fuck Washington I getting my money. At least I can spend it
                    better than they can.

                    thank you for working with me on the shipping man. You are truly first
                    class. Cash came today and it looks so good on my table. Can I post a
                    pic? People need to know about this place.

       I
                    just fucked my GF after taking her out on the town. I spent a ton of
                    money tonight but I will order more in about a week. Nobody said
                    anything when I paid using the preshreded cash, dinner, shopping, bottle
                    service at the club, all paid in cash and no body cared.

       Talk
                    about weird things meant to happen…. I am at home today with the flu
                    and was exploring the dark web and found your site. This will change my
                    life. All month I though about quitting my job because I hate it. I cant
                    believe sites like this exist. I never been on tor before. It was so
                    easy. They sent me payment instructions and about an hour later I had
                    the tracking information. Tomorrow by noon $6,650 will be in my hand.
                    Just as long as I can keep myself off the toilet long enough to open the
                    box.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       This is life changing. Thank you. I know its stolen but still thank you. The government needs to send
                    us this refund.

       Sounds
                    like you guys have found my out about my best kept secret on crypto
                    trading. These guys are great for covering loses. If you season the cash
                    (leave it in a checking account for a couple months) you can open up a
                    trading account anywhere cryptos or otherwise. When you make gains you
                    are multiplying your gains. When it drops you can cover your own loses.
                    Its a sweet deal.

       I
                    have cash coming on tuesday per fedex. I am going to be able to make up
                    my loses in bitcoin with the discount you sell your cash for. I hope
                    you guys are around for a while if bitcoin keeps going down I am going
                    to need to make up the loses with the preshred cash.

       I
                    have ordered here for a while now. The cash is good but now I am
                    getting used to it. The fun part for me is how they hide it. Each
                    delivery they hide the cash in something unique.

       Thanks
                    for working with me on the certificates. Its a great idea. I dont know
                    if that is something you make public or not. So I wont go into detail.
                    But the service is outstanding. Now I have a nearly unlimited source to
                    sell my cash to and keep my wealth outside the eyes of the tax man.

       Are the euros also pre-shred cash or is it converted from pre-shred dollars to ordinary euros?

       Yeah.
                    they are pretty crazy. My first package came as a wrapped birthday
                    present with a Mr. Potato Head doll inside. I never knew you could stuff
                    so much cash into a Mr. Potato Head before.

       I
                    thought I was buying really good counterfeit $10,000 worth. Fedex
                    dropped a box off this afternoon and there was a little over $10,000
                    inside. This is actually real cash. Is is safe for me to have isn’t this
                    stolen money from the government?

       Hey Guys/Gals here are a few updates…………………………………..
       <br/>
       <br/>
       People
                    are starting to pay attention to the ordering rules. Thank you it helps
                    keep shipments going out in a timely manner. However, we are seeing a
                    problem with people paying after their 24 hours quote expires.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       DO
                    NOT PAY AFTER YOUR QUOTE HAS EXPIRED !!! Otherwise your payment will be
                    lost! We are serious about this. If you pay after 24 hours your wallet
                    ID is not longer valid. We do not have access to it. It doesn’t matter
                    how much you beg and tell us… There is nothing we an do. If you feel
                    your 24 quote is nearly up, email us for a new quote. It is that simple !
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Also,
                    our treasury contact has notified us that 96 series 100 USD bills are
                    no longer coming in. Most of these bills have been destroyed. Please do
                    not ask for 96 series 100’s USD. We an not accommodate the request. We
                    do however still see large amounts of 2003 series 100 USD bills. As of
                    this time they are not impacted.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       One more thing….. dont ask for 1’s and 5’s we dont use them as they are
                    too small and take up too much space to fill orders.
       <br/>
       <br/>

       Finally
                    received by post the silver package. Euro notes were placed inside a
                    childs toy. The package was damaged and the toy was broken however the
                    Euro was not exposed.

       Question.
                    I have a large tax bill I need to pay. The cash came in today – TY BTW –
                    Does anyone have any experience using your preshred to pay off IRS
                    bills? Do they even care as long as I pay? I owe about 9 grand.

       Hi
                    Brad and Ace please be cool with the volume of cargo because we can’t
                    following all packages is it to much, you guy do crazy everyday with the
                    shipping partner.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       We do not even have times to open all the packages and take some for us, please reduce
                    the shipping to every Monday.
       <br/>

       If
                    you are purchasing please make sure you read the “Our Methods” page as
                    well as all the directions on the ordering page. We are getting stupid
                    fucking emails asking questions you should already know. Do your
                    homework. You are buying real cash not counterfeit. We are going to stop
                    processing orders that dont follow the instructions. We are too fucking
                    busy to hold your hand.

       i
                    am hearing from some sources that you guys are the real deal. finally
                    someone who delivers. I almost gave up on the whole dark web thing.
       <br/>
       I ordered the standard package. I didnt order
                    anything higher because I know for sure they at least send that.

       I
                    took a HUGE leap of faith on this one and bought 50k. I asked for all
                    100’s but they said they cant do it. They could do half 100’s and the
                    rest other bills.

                    counterfeit vendors talk alot of shit about how bad cashgod is. They
                    say your buying stolen money, counterfeit isnt stolen from nobody….

                    I spent thousands in counterfeit before buying from here. Those fuckers
                    are losing business to Ace and his team and they dont like it. Fuck
                    them! I can tell you from experience, now I do not sweat bullets when I
                    spend the cash like I did when I tried to unload counterfeit. I have
                    zero exposure with the real cash cashgod!

                    our business and bought 10k with overnight. They came through though
                    communication was a bit slow.
       <br/>
       These guys can help me launder some profits and I am really happy about that. Its

       <br/>
       I would suggest you dont order more than
                    you dont mind getting stolen.

       ooooohhhhhh
                    snap! I got the $5,000 package in the mail so I took out my bro’s to
                    HOOTERS! The waitress was some bitch with B cup breasts. I wrote on the
                    receipt that I would let her suck my dick for $50 and I left my phone
                    number. But the bitch hasnt texted me yet. Now that I have money those
                    Hooters bitches need to learn their fucking place. I’m going back with
                    my boys later this week. I’m a man now and I’m gonna own that restruant!
                    Real men go to fucking hooters to see the boobies

                    ended up making me hate myself. Tonight I bought a bunch of jack
                    Daniels and I’m going to drink away my problems. Dont make my same

                    So it’s safe to say that is the real deal. At least for me. So you can
                    except something in return. Loyalty.

       I
                    go to a technical college paid 4 with this cash. So I like this girl I
                    go to school with. I decided she would like me if I protected her. So I
                    started secretly following her home, watching her run in the park, and
                    following her to the grocery store. Then if she got in trouble I could
                    save the day. But the bitch noticed and said I was creepy! All those
                    hours of protection and that’s what I get. I know – such a bitch right?
                    So I decided to be a hero and protect her by watching her while she
                    sleeps from her bedroom window. But this bitch called the cops on me!
                    Money doesnt solve all lifes problems, you’ll still find bitches like
                    this one. This story will have a happy ending though, I’m going to show
                    her my dick while we’re waiting for the class to start. I would love to
                    see boobs, so she would love to see dick. it’s going to be great

       I think there is supernotes that look better and in better condition than the pre-shred cash.

       In all

       A
                    friend of mine ordered and i was waiting to order until his came. It
                    arrived Friday and he came over to open it together. I wanted to see it
                    for myself.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The package was in a USPS box. I was expecting to see
                    Fedex but whatever…… Inside was 5 dvd movies.. I read other got these
                    too… All the movie were wrapped in plastic and looked new…. each dvd had
                    about a $1000 mixed bills.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The cash is beat up like others have commented on but very spendable.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I
                    just put my order in for the professional now that I know its legit and I will actually get something.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I
                    will report back when I get my order.

       I
                    had the same problem I bought from cash lords and they ripped me off.
                    there are also cashgod clones out there too. I used the hidden wiki
                    and bought here.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       They deliver and the cash is real. No counterfeit. That makes my life a hell of a lot
                    easier.

       Maybe the inventory

       Not
                    to rub it in or anything but now I am the “Pro” 50 grand. This is
                    more many than I have ever seen. Ill admit I was shitting my pants
                    waiting for this.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       BTW…. my cash came inside a small suitcase. It
                    was a new suitcase with tags and everything on it from Amazon. At least
                    it looks like it was from Amazon.

      <p>
       Greetings Guys &amp; Gals
       <br/>
       <br/>
       For
                    the fucking complainers out of Asia stop your bitching. Shit happens.
                    We are working on a shipping solution. As soon as we have it I will
                    announce it.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       As for inventory…….. we are seeing a ton of orders
                    coming in from around the world as bitcoin and other currencies drop in
                    value. Consequently, inventory on all currencies has dropped
                    significantly. GBP is extremely low and we may stop selling it very
                    soon.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       If order volume continues to be high we may start denying
                    orders. We will only fill orders we can ship. If you email and order and
                    you receive a quote then you are good. However, if you are not sure if
                    you want to order we ask you do not ask for a quote unless you are
                    buying. This way others who really need the cash can get their orders
                    processed. Its the only way we can do it.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       If you are serious
                    about ordering then get your orders in NOW. We can not guarantee how
                    long we will have enough supply. Please don’t beg and plead for us to
                    fill your order if you miss out.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       DO NOT BE LEFT BEHIND! ORDER NOW
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Spend Wisely My Friends
       <br/>

                    more good points. Govs are fucking with everything. I thought for sure
                    bitcoin was going to be truly independent of govs policy. Oh well….. so
                    much for that.

       This

                    delivery every two weeks. You need to have another contact in Thailand
                    to resume payments.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       It is not my problem so I should not be without my regular shipments.

       As
                    you can see the deep state is working its magic once again. Crypto
                    prices are dropping for one reason only. To stop North Korea. The only
                    way to keep North Korea out of the crypto game was to kill the values.
                    As always the rest of us get caught up as “Casualties of War”
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The
                    fundamentals of bitcoin remain the same. There is only 21 million ever
                    to be created. Plus all the small players are jumping out providing an
                    excellent buy opportunity.

       Unfortunately
                    we have had to suspend deliveries to south east asia. Our contact their
                    has decided to retire from the business. Due to customs processes in
                    Vietnam and Thailand we can not use regular shipping processes.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       We
                    will make an announcement when we have an alternate solution available.
                    For those of you in the EP program in those countries you regular
                    shipments will not take place until we have a solution.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       All other shipments and countries are not effected
                    my this.

                    years to save enough to go. cashgod helped make it happen in 2
                    weeks and it only cost me $1250. My kids loved it. Thank you Brad and

       Those
                    are good points…. Its best to use cash as much as you can but it is
                    getting harder to do it Government was to track you as much as they can
                    so they can tax the shit out of you.

       I
                    missed the bitcoin run. It sucks. I bought bitcoin to buy a Pro
                    package but I was too afraid to do it. Now I wish I did. With the
                    bitcoin I have I can only afford a free agent now. I feel like its too
                    late.

       I
                    ONLY use cash. I would not risk making a deposit at all. I have no debt
                    and if I want to make payments for bills I pay at the office or kiosk
                    if the company has that option. For example power, cable, water. For
                    cell I pay in cash at the store.

                    does not allow you to pay your credit card in cash at a branch which is

       My
                    cash is pretty beat up and some of it has dried blood or something on
                    it. Its beat to shit I can see why the federal reserve is getting rid of
                    it. But money is money it all spends the same. I wish I would have
                    gotten some of the newer bills others were getting thats all.

       The
                    best thing you can do if you comprehend this is not about money. This
                    is about shutting the Federal Reserve down. I will reinvest right back
                    into crypto. Do you see that there can only be a certain amount of cash
                    throughout if you know anything about supply and demand you will
                    understand this group of patriots are not on a main objective to gain
                    monetary paper that of which is right now worthless. This will give
                    everyone a chance to build this money and spend like a normal person
                    just spend at least 2 times but not more than 4 of what you normally do.
                    Destabilize the Jesuit private bank we call Federal Reserve. I cant
                    tell who else it may be or related and controlled by money is a tool
                    that is obsolete. Bitcoin will along with other crypto gain control over
                    the amendment in the executive order has completed its plan. Which
                    paraphrasing is that any enemy of this country Rotschild, Bilderburg,
                    Clinton, Podesta Seth’s murderer by hiring his ms 13 then the rogue ops
                    killed. Breaking the system 1 day at a time

                    been doing it for years. Like other businesses I went digital and I only
                    take bitcoin and monero. I use these guys to cash my bitcoin out.
                    Before that I sold it on LBC. But the return I get here is the best.
                    Plus bitcoin can go up and down all it likes. I am not concerned. I set
                    up a company and have cash deposits all the time. No problems at the
                    bank either.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I do disagree with their website. They say its
                    “Safe”. Nothing is 100% safe. In the end its stolen money any way you
                    look at it. Just be smart and you will be fine.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       One more thing.
                    They dont always ship overnight when you order overnight and sometimes
                    you will get less money than you ordered but other times they send more.
                    IDK why maybe they can answer that. Good luck getting random questions
                    answered. They are not real good a quick communication.

                    the court is stealing over half my check. The cash from here is nice.

       No
                    one answered me earlier and I am impatient. I went to the bank and made

                    I sent some pics over from my package on Friday. I had already opened
                    it and threw the stuff in the garbage. I pulled it out and too some
                    pics.

       Hello Guys/Gals
       <br/>
       <br/>
       It
                    has been a crazy start to 2019. We are swamped with orders. The
                    majority these orders are coming from first time clients. Everyone seems
                    to have a new years resolution to get rich in 2019. Even though these
                    are smaller orders it has drawn down our inventory significantly. I will
                    be adjusting inventory levels to reflect that fact.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       For 2019 we
                    are updating our site with some new pics. Yeah I know, you been asking
                    for that. Well, your request has not fallen on deaf ears. But, we need
                    your help to do it.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       We are asking for our customers to send us
                    pics of you receiving your cash and your unpackaging process. Please do
                    not include faces or anything else that would reveal your identity.
                    Anyone who sends us pics will receive 10% off on their next order. If we
                    use your pic for our website we will fill your next order at 50% off.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Make
                    sure you tell us a name to use for your pic should it be selected. Be
                    creative, and no real names please. I would prefer not to have a bunch
                    of pics from anonymous. We need every package type, USD, Euro, and GBP
                    from basic to standard, and standard to pro.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You can send your pics to us at
                    cashgod@protonmail.com. For the script kiddies who think they are
                    clever we will be opening these attachments in a sterile environment.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Change your Fortunes in 2019!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Spend
                    Wisely My Friends,

                    if you are just figuring this out good for you. I held back from doing
                    anything because of all the negative press but I did it anyway. I am
                    $5000 richer because I did. THe powers that be will always try to hold
                    us back.

       The
                    governments want to take out bitcoin so they can keep the rest of the
                    people on the fiat tit. They are hypocrites. How are they trying to
                    protect they people when they are responsible for wiping out 200 billion
                    in crypto market value in 2 days.

       What
                    a mess! I was supposed to get the cash last Friday. Then I get an email
                    from Brad and he said it was returned. I have no idea why. I again
                    verified the address and it was sent out again. It was supposed to get
                    here today but it was delayed because of the weather.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       This is Horse Shit. Everyone else gets their money
                    and I have to wait.

       Hi,
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Has anyone had an issue with the delivery not getting stolen from your porch? I realized I wont be
                    home when it arrives.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I wouldn’t want my $10,000 in stolen cash to be stolen by someone else. Its kind of
                    confusing.

       Fucking
                    governments ruin everything. Bitcoin is a perfect currency and what do
                    they do, fuck with it. They are all worried that bitcoin is too volatile
                    and that they need “laws” to protect the consumer.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Its bullshit.
                    There meddling has cost people a lot of money over the past couple of
                    days. They are doing the very thing they say they are trying to protect
                    the people from.

       Your comments section sucks. I keep getting a message to slow down I am posting too fast. I was only sending 1

       It finally submitted but I dont see it on the site. You need to fix it.

       I
                    am now convinced that our government has no intent of taking care of
                    us. I live in Hawaii and I really thought I was going to die.

       Our
                    elected officials here are millionaires while the rest of us work our
                    asses off just to get by. I was trolling this site for a few weeks now
                    and unsure if I should buy. I am taking back my money from the
                    government the only way I know how. $50,000 ordered with overnight.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       This is a revolution! I’m tired of
                    everyone else making out and I’m not.

                    if those buyers were real they would have never posted anything about

      <p>
       This is what I suggest……
       <br/>
       <br/>
       1. Get $10,000 – $25,000 in 20’s
       <br/>
       2. Throw the cash all over the bed (or a
                    floor will do)
       <br/>
       3. Invite over your girlfriend (or pay a whore)
       <br/>
       4. Fuck her brains out while she lies on the
                    cash
       <br/>
       5. Slow down when you need to dont cum too fast
       <br/>
       6. When you are ready lauch all your hot jizz all over
                    the cash
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Trust me IT FEELS FANTASTIC

       I needed a car and used cashgod to make it happen. I did my research before I did anything and it worked
                    out.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Here is what I learned:
       <br/>
       <br/>
       1. I bought the Professional ($10,000)
       <br/>
       2. Ask for large bills.
       <br/>
       3.
                    Buy your car (used) at auction.
       <br/>
       4. Make sure the out the door price is less than $10,000
       <br/>
       5. Per IRS
                    guidelines any transaction in cash $10,000 or higher has to be reported.
       <br/>
       6. I paid $8,300 for my car after fees
                    and taxes.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I
                    know its not as glorious as to what some other people are doing here
                    but I did get a good deal. I paid $1250 to buy the Professional and
                    ended up with a car that’s worth about $9,000 if I sold it to a private
                    seller.

                    on tuesday.

       Thanks Joe for the comments and the research. Just so you know we have had prior customer who tried to do the
                    same thing to us.

      <p>
       I
                    have finished some research regarding a particular group who is making
                    there presence known on the dark-net. They have sent several demands for
                    100 BTC or they will take down several of the most popular dark web
                    vendors. They have going after Brad and his team for a couple of
                    months. They threaten to “destroy market confidence” and “make sure no
                    one will do business with you again”. So you may have noticed many false
                    negative reviews around forums and other places.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I must say this
                    group is sophisticated. They have been able to use bots to post several
                    thousand random posts on various clear-net and dark-net boards
                    discouraging people from doing business with cashgod. After
                    additional research I can confirm this same group cloned cashgod and
                    renamed it cashCompany.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       PsyOps is nothing new but this group
                    shows signs of gov backing. Either its our “Cousins” with “Christians in
                    Action” or its another player such as North Korea. My initial thoughts
                    steer me toward North Korea. It makes sense that they would attempt to
                    extort bitcoin from Brad and his team, clone cashgod, create a new
                    site called cash Company, and then scam those customers who visit their
                    site. The timing of incidents correlate.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Its no secret that
                    various USA based agencies have been using PsyOps to scare prospective
                    buyers and attempt to close down cashgod, perhaps to varying
                    success. However, it usually is not typical for them to use extortion in
                    these cases. The USA agencies have plenty of money to work with whereas
                    North Korea does not.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       My best advice to people reading this is
                    remember that any public forum can and is used to perform PsyOps.
                    Deepdotweb is a haven for gov agencies. They used it to steer people to a
                    very popular market place which was being run my the Dutch government
                    using positive feedback to lure people in.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I know JC and others
                    have recommended going private, as existing clients already know the
                    legitimacy of Brad and his team and receive product regularly. I can
                    only say this; The more you limit your sale of pre-shred cash to the
                    public the more the gov agencies as well as extortion groups win the
                    war. I suggest Brad, you do not give in. Will there be people who will
                    be scared away and not get the pre-shred cash, yes, but there are others
                    who will push past the rhetoric and stand up to the gov and rightfully
                    take back the cash the gov has stolen from them for years.

                    Comments on dark web boards from a few months ago looked good but then I
                    noticed more negative reviews recently.

       I
                    don’t agree JC. The more clients that purchase in the public realm the
                    more the money is spread out. Like the onion concept it keeps the money
                    distribution into the public making it harder for any one person to get
                    caught.

       I don’t come from money and having $10,000 in cash is a little strange to me and it makes me

      <p>
       Notes for newbies &amp; first timers
       <br/>
       1.) Read the entire order processing TWICE before asking questions to
                    Brad and his team
       <br/>
       2.)
                    Buy a little more than the quoted price to account for transfer fees
                    (min $100 extra). For the $5000 (standard) which costs $750, buy $850
                    worth of BTC. The price they quote you at is the price you pay
                    regardless of BTC goes up/down
       <br/>
       3.) When sending the BTC to the wallet
                    address and calculate a fee that will transfer quickly usually ~30 min.
                    (I didn’t do this and it took 13+ hrs to confirm the transaction. You
                    will end up having to send them an email and your order could
                    potentially get cancelled)
       <br/>
       4.) I recommend purchasing the overnight or the fastest shipping available to you.
       <br/>
       5.)
                    Like it’s been stated, do NOT deposit or make purchases in excess of
                    $10,000. Person to person transactions should be okay (buying a used car
                    from a person) but depositing/purchasing anything that has the
                    potential to leave a paper trail (banks, stores, etc) is obviously
                    stupid.

                    can you limit the comments to only people who have purchase, received,
                    and used the cash? Most people are looking information on the process
                    and what to do when they get the money.

       I

                    ordered $1300 and it came 4 days later. All I know is its stolen money. I
                    would never deposit it at the bank.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I like some of the ideas
                    from the forums on how spend it. The casino idea is pretty good. I read
                    some other reviews on another board about you guys and your long time
                    customers seems to really be making a killing.

       It
                    looks like bitcoin is about to make another move. Hang on boys and
                    girls and get ready for the ride. Brad, the EP program is not a secret
                    everyone knows about it. Who cares anyway. So what if a bunch of noobs
                    want in. Once they do a large amount of business with you like I and
                    others have then they can join in.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Again I still think you need
                    to take the program and make it private. Why deal with all the bullshit.
                    Who gives a shit if the general public believes you or not?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       No
                    offense but I think you are trying to be altruistic, which is nice, but
                    people aren’t going to appreciate what you do in the end. They are just
                    going to piss the money away like they always have and end up with
                    nothing.

       The

                    currency exchange and its real. I can not see a difference. I have used
                    some of it and no one has said anything. I am thinking of taking some
                    Euro to the airport and exchange for USD there. I will know for sure its
                    clean.

       Some comments….
       <br/>
       <br/>
       1. Ordered 1300 quid and it arrived my post today.
       <br/>
       2. Notes are authentic and all NEW.
                    I thought this was cash to be destroyed?
       <br/>
       3. Stealth packaging was done right.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       It remains unclear to me
                    if the bills are real or counterfeit. I am unable to tell the difference.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Please only respond if you
                    actually ordered.

                    you should not be depositing $15k all at one time. If you read any of
                    the forums you should know that. Yes, you fucked up big time. Walking
                    away and making a big deal of it did not help you either.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Listen
                    people, DO NOT DEPOSIT MORE THAN $10,000 ON THE SAME DAY! Even better,
                    wait at least a week between deposits. Depositing on Fridays is
                    preferable since its Pay Day for most people. Its not unusual for people
                    to be depositing cash.

       The bank is telling me I have to fill out a form to make a $15,000 deposit. I told them “No”. Am I going to have
                    problems?

       UPDATES!!!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       New
                    inventory is in !!! Our first batch of 2019! I will be adjusting
                    inventory levels to reflect the fact. GBP customers we are still low on
                    GBP and will likely be so until late next week. USD and EURO are back to
                    good levels.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       If we get another email from a fucktard asking for
                    instructions on how to order I am going to go insane. Read the fucking
                    website. If you are illiterate or unable to follow instructions then you
                    were likely destined to be poor because managing large amounts of money
                    is impossible for you.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Reminder, to please make sure you tell us
                    in your email that you want cash shipped internationally. Otherwise you
                    will get the wrong quote and your shipment will be delayed.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       For
                    you first timers do not give us a fake address. Its stupid and all it
                    does is prevent you from getting your cash. We do not put a return
                    address if your cash cant be delivered to you. All that does is make
                    Fedex richer and they have enough fucking money.

       Just
                    some advice… I ordered $25,000 in $10’s and its a stack almost a foot
                    long, I would have gotten $20’s or $100’s if I did it again

       Any
                    suggestions on how to buy BTC with the most stealth? Since the new
                    largest package is now $10k I feel like that would raise an eyebrow or
                    two if I came to Wells Fargo every 2 weeks with that kind of cash to
                    exchange for BTC. Thanks!

       Brad, I just finished 8 hours of Black Jack make 400% on my money. The best part was my buy in $$ was pre shred.

       On
                    my next order I am going to buy some chips slow play and cash out. I
                    think someone else here was doing that. I like it. Clean money in the
                    end.

       So
                    I am a first time customer and bought the 10k deal. Most of the cash I
                    got was in 20’s. I am trying to convert my cash into my local currency.
                    The guy at the exchange said he doesn’t buy 20’s only 100’s. I guess I
                    will order 100’s with my next order.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Brad have you heard of anything like this before?

       So
                    I’ve flipping through my cash and it look 100% legit. I’ve used
                    counterfeit before and this is NOT counterfeit. Quick question – Does
                    everyone use the ATM to put the cash in or do people go inside

                    hello “Clinton”, so you work for the government do you? You probably
                    get overpaid with my tax dollars to do something that is completely

       Is
                    this cash perfect? no its not. Is it in bad shape? Nope. Will it go
                    through an ATM? Yes probably 1/25 bills wont make it through machines no
                    matter how you put it in. But just spend those elsewhere.

       My
                    Basic pack arrived. It was in a shipment from Amazon. I open the
                    package and there is a shrink wrapped DVD called PS I Love You staring
                    Hilary Swank and Gerard Butler. At first I was like, where the fuck is
                    my cash. So I peel off the plastic from the DVD,opened it up, and behold
                    a sealed mylar bag. I got some scissors opened up the bag and YESSSS
                    cash all 20’s. I used my counterfeit pen and ultraviolet light on the
                    bills. They are real. I can feel the raised print as well. VERY NICE.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I will be ordering again after my 2

       Several
                    orders have been shipped today please check your emails for tracking
                    information. Some of you dumb fucks have listed a temporary anonymous
                    email address, and your tracking info gets bounced back to us. WE HAVE
                    NO OTHER WAY TO CONTACT YOU!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       This is the time of year when the
                    crazies come out of their moms basement and demand extortion money or
                    they threaten to post negative reviews and “destroy our business”. WE
                    WILL NEVER PAY EXTORTION MONEY! Post away. Most of our business comes
                    from existing clients anyway.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I am also getting several emails
                    from people who want to immediately join our Elite Program with their
                    first order. THAT WONT HAPPEN!
       <br/>
       The Elite Program is AN EXCLUSIVE
                    PROGRAM and is not advertised, unfortunately we have some members who
                    like to boast they are in it. Per program rules IT IS NOT TO BE
                    DISCLOSED. The EP Program is an invitation only program. DO NOT INVITE
                    YOURSELF ITS TACKY!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       We should be getting more “inventory” this week. Once we do I will update our inventory
                    levels.

                    Hate to break it to but your her bitch. You need to put her in her
                    place with a few open handed strikes. She’ll never learn if you don’t
                    put some power behind them to make it memorable. After 5-10 minutes of
                    this you say “Honey I love you, and YOU made me do this to you, I didn’t
                    want to, and its your fault.” Trust me son, this is the only way she’ll
                    learn to obey your command in the home.

       Brad!!!
                    YOUR FUCKING AWESOME!!!! I cant believe this worked and its a total
                    life changer! I was gonna buy counterfeit and then I thought “What the
                    hell I am doing? Niggers go to jail for counterfeit!” So I bought from
                    Brad instead and it was the best decision of my life!! I seriously
                    think about you when I’m banging my boyfriend in the ass. GOOD SHIT!!!!
                    AWESOME!!!!!

       Happy
                    new year to you too Brad. 2018 indeed was a profitable year. A year
                    ago this time we were dealing with coin around $900. The market has come
                    a long way. I still think its a bubble and it will go bust any moment.

       Thanks
                    Brad for the new year wishes…Look this isnt a really big deal but the
                    last package I got (5,000 EURO) was short 200. Its not a really big deal
                    but at the same time thats my money and I want it. I emailed you asking
                    for you to mail the remaining 200 but you said you’ll include it in
                    your next order. Kind of upset about it but I guess 4,800 is still good.

       Happy New Year My Fellow Rebels!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Its
                    officially 2019 and it is going to be an incredible year. We are going
                    on 2 years in business which is ancient for the darknet. The last 2
                    weeks of the month were crazy busy many of our large clients were
                    laundering cash and we had several new customers who found wealth in
                    bitcoin and were looking for a better return using us to move their coin
                    to cash. All of our inventory levels are low. However we are expecting
                    to replenish our inventory this week.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Spend Wisely My Friends

      <br/>
      <p>
       EVERYONE LISTEN TO ME!!! the world is going to end, follow these steps if you want to LIVE
       <br/>
       1. Buy cash from
                    these guys
       <br/>
       2. Buy GOLD and SILVER with the cash
       <br/>
       3. Buy GUNS with the cash
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Soon
                    you will be able to buy 1 acre of land with 1oz of silver. You will
                    burn the inflated dollar to heat your house You will sell the Gold to
                    the Aliens in exchange for not being anal probed. This will all happen.
                    When your buying land with silver, heating your house with cash and not
                    being anal probed you will thank me.

       Most
                    of the cash I got was in good shape but a few $20’s didn’t go through
                    the ATM. I emailed mr Brad about it and said he sent me replacements
                    today. Its weird to have decent customer service on the dark net. Most
                    vendors are faggots. Lets see if the replacements really come though
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Now
                    I have to wait a week and a half before I can order another package.
                    Brad any chance you’ll relax that “You can only order every 2 weeks”
                    policy? That sucks I could really use another $2,500 before next
                    weekend.

       I
                    think its time to fire your packaging people. This is the second time I
                    have been shorted. $5000 Semi Pro package was received and I am
                    counting $4920 in my shipment.

       I
                    just came across your site. I have bitcoin that I have been saving for
                    years. I bought it when it was low. This can be a great resource for me
                    to unload bitcoin and get an even higher return.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Can I buy some larger than $50,000? Maybe $100,000?

       We are

       <br/>
       <br/>
       We
                    will likely need to lower the inventory indicator as we are shipping a
                    hell of a lot of money. If you want cash for stocking suffers get it
                    now! I would hate for you to be the one to get the email that says we
                    cant send you cash!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Our Elite Program Clients will be getting
                    their regular shipments over the holiday period with no interruptions. I
                    know several of our EP clients has emailed demanding a $200,000
                    package. ITS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN! Everyone deserves the right to getting
                    our stolen pre shred cash. We are not about to do what our government
                    does and only pay attention to the 1%.
       <br/>

       Happy Holidays &amp; Spend Wisely

                    deals a couple times a month. I dont have big money like him but can I
                    get a discount since I was referred by him? He said you would know him
                    by his sign SARLEX.

                    They must think I’m a weird. I swear I will order soon, I just need to
                    figure out the bitcon and a good wallet.

       Hey
                    So I got your cash and deposited it in the bank, but I’m worrying that
                    the bank lady is going to call the FBI. She was looking at me
                    suspiciously when I deposited $5,000 cash. I joked with her I got it
                    selling drugs but she should know that was a joke right.

      <p>
       I
                    read a lot of negative shit about this place when doing my research
                    (despite that I still ordered…I know I know) I did the bare minimum they
                    would sell me which was 1300 bucks and I paid $325. As soon as I hit
                    send from my bitcoin wallet I felt a pit in my stomach that I probably
                    wont see the that money again.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Oh.. I ordered last week btw on
                    wednesday. I never did get a confirmation number or anything. I even
                    sent a couple of emails and no response. I figured.. fucked again and
                    learned yet another lesson.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Fast forward to this evening around
                    6. The door bell rings and its fedex with a delivery. It was from some
                    media company in fresno CA. I looked at the name and it was the fake one
                    I gave when I ordered from cashgod. Again, I was a skeptic and
                    figured there is probably a pile of shit inside the box or at least a
                    picture of someone flipping me off. I opened it and inside a 2 DVD’s,
                    brand new (Armageddon &amp; Sphere). I remember reading in the forums
                    people getting DVD’s with cash inside so I opened it up and inside no
                    DVD’s but a mylar bag sealed shut. Inside the mylar bad was all 100
                    dollar bills. $1700 and not the $1300 I ordered.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I am not sure
                    why all the bad press. Maybe its because they dont email fast. I am not
                    sure. I am starting to believe what others have told me that maybe
                    police or something are posting negative stuff in order to frighten
                    people away. All I know is I not only got cash but more than I paid for.
                    I am really happy about that.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Now I understand why the gov wants
                    to shut these guys down. If they are getting this money the way they
                    say they are,then they are really screwing over the fed. Well I guess
                    good for us. I can only speak to my experience and say I paid for cash
                    and I got cash.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       My lesson from this experience, sometimes things
                    are what they say they are. I hope you find this informative and it
                    helps you in making an informed decision.

       Doing
                    your due diligence is important but on the dark net you have to be
                    careful. Reddit, youtube, deepdotweb, they have all been infiltrated by
                    NSA, FBI, InterPol, the IRS cyber crimes unit etc. I have stopped
                    trusting “reviews” a long time ago on websites. Its all bullshit anyway.
                    Your best source is THW. Its the ONLY place to get real untainted
                    information.

       Has
                    anyone here sold bit coin in person? I am trying to figure out how to
                    get rid of the cash and turn it into bit coin. I do not want to do any
                    electronic type stuff because I do not want it traced.

       I
                    am very conflicted about this. I feel bad that its stolen money, but I
                    need it. So, I guess its ok. I pay taxes that the government misspends
                    on stupid stuff anyway. Thats me rationalizing out loud making
                    everything better.

       I
                    completed my first trade with these guys and so far I am impressed.
                    $2500 test trade ordered last Thursday and the package arrived today.
                    $2500 inside a DVD case of Ghostbusters (in German) with 100’s, all post
                    96 series, though a little beat up its still very spendable.

       I
                    am going to use these guys to move my bitcoin, I was going to LBC but
                    those fuckers low ball on price. Here I get a return plus I dont have
                    some large company tracking “chats” like on LBC.

       Buying stolen cash feels so good and so right. Its like slipping my middle finger right up the asshole of our

       Why

       The
                    US is not so innocent. Look, the fact is the odds are stacked against
                    us. Wall Street and a few elite have control of the money system and we
                    are so stupid to believe in it. Listen people get your head out of your
                    ass and stop the rat race you are in. How hard do you work everyday just
                    to get a few slips of paper that a government says is worth something.
                    Actually, now you dont even get paper. Its just numbers in a computer
                    system. In the end this will all go to shit.

       I was ordering counterfeit in the marketplaces but this beats anything they are offering. Real cash at discount
                    prices.

                    I want to partner and sell your cash on Ebay. We could make so much
                    money that way. I sent you an email but didnt hear back. I just got my
                    order but you haven’t emailed me back about the Ebay deal Big shot

                    never bought anything like this before but know I have a better
                    understanding as to the process. I sent my email for an order. Just
                    waiting to here back on the next steps.

       Like
                    many people I was skeptical when I saw this site. Cheap cash, real cash
                    and not counterfeit. It seemed like a dream come true. I ordered the
                    25k deal. I know, probably not the smartest thing to do, I should have
                    tested it with $1300. I thought to myself that if its real then I need
                    as much as I can get.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       My Experience:
       <br/>
       <br/>
       $25,000 Order on 12-7-17
       <br/>
       Received Tracking Number from Fedex
                    in 2-3 hours
       <br/>
       Order Arrived 12-12-17
       <br/>
       Large Box with Xbox 360 Inside
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Now
                    I was a little confused here. I wasn’t sure why I was getting an Xbox
                    360 and at first I was pissed. I thought I had been had. I then remember
                    someone writing on these forums that they received cash inside a VCR or
                    something. So I open the Xbox 360 and inside was my money. They took
                    all the insides out and shrink wrapped the money.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I counted the money and it was exactly $25,000
                    (Unfortunately no extra like others had experienced)
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I used my counterfeit pen and checked the currency
                    none were counterfeit.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I
                    hope this helps. There was a lot of ups and downs ordering this. I
                    never bought anything online like this. Now I am glad I did and will buy
                    again.

       I
                    have a question, we have paid our bills and then some with the cash. We
                    got another $10,000 last Friday and I am not sure what to do with it. I
                    know that sounds crazy. I don’t want to deposit it in the bank because
                    we have done that already and I don’t want to raise suspicion. I am
                    nervous about keeping this amount of cash in the house. Any suggestions?

                    Arrival date is Wednesday 13 December. I got $10,000 and asked for all
                    100’s. They told me I could only get about 50% in 100s because of the
                    high demand right now. I am not the only person getting christmas money!

                    and they gave me a wallet number to send my bitcoin to. I sent it right
                    away received a shipping confirmation. I waited a few days more and got a
                    package of money in the mail! Now I have lots of money! It real!

       Hey
                    JC I think you are right. The system is rigged for the 99% of us who
                    bust our ass everyday. I was hesitant to buy here but the more I think
                    about it the more pissed I get at our gov and its failure to support its
                    people.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I am opposed to violence but I have not problem buying
                    here and getting back MY MONEY that the gov takes in taxes every year,
                    plus penalties that I calculate 😉

       Now
                    it look like the USA futures markets are trading Bitcoin contracts. I
                    knew at some point these greedy banks were going to get involved and try
                    to manipulate the price of Bitcoin. It wont happen. I think the banks
                    have met their match with Bitcoin. Immediately the price went us 22%
                    after the debut of the futures contracts. HAHAHA! Short sellers are not
                    their even though the “Fake News” says they are. More bullshit from the
                    conventional world. Governments hate not having control. Once again the
                    power is moving towards the people.

       We
                    use cash lords to launder our bitcoin to cash. Its better than using
                    LBC and we get real cash in return. If you are involved in
                    “nontraditional” lines of business this is a excellent resource for your
                    cash management.

       Yeah I also ask myself if the Euro notes are real… In the descrption they talk only about USD notes and where
                    they come from.

       Hey Horko –
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Yes
                    they are 100% genuine euro notes. We exchange USD for Euro and charge
                    you a little extra for the hassle to exchange it. Euro is shipped from
                    Germany
       <br/>

       Yeah
                    I have had a couple of orders that were delivered on Saturday. I
                    noticed that some people complained about poor service, I have never
                    seen it. I get my order on time each time with no bullshit.

      <p>
       I just joined the $25k club!! Holy smokes it feels so good to hold that much cash! My next order will be for
                    $100k!!!
       <br/>
       It
                    was packaged very well. The cash was vacuum sealed inside a
                    non-transparent bag with a big label on it reading “First Edition of
                    Fahrenheit 451” and “Do not expose to oxygen until ready”. All the cash
                    even felt like a big thick book when vacuum sealed also. The cash was in
                    good condition, no bills in really bad shape.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Very pleased you just made a repeat customer!!

                    make this a way of living and after seeing the comments, I know this is
                    official… Maybe the most official thing you can do on here period, if
                    you guys want bitcoins and I want money… It’s a win, win situation!

       Hi Guys &amp; Gals
       <br/>
       <br/>
       We
                    had a hiccup with our systems this week which delayed responses for new
                    orders. There was no impact to existing orders and those of you who get
                    regular EP shipments. If you were impacted, sorry about that. Its fixed
                    now and we fired the guy who fucked it up.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       If you are looking to
                    get cash for the upcoming holidays I suggest you do it now. Last year
                    at this time we were slammed. We will keep send cash as long as we have
                    the inventory, first come, first served.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Also Bitcoin has really
                    moved over the past 2 weeks. If you bought in prior now is the time to
                    leverage that. You will be able to get more cash for your coin using or
                    services. Take advantage of it while you can. Odds are Bitcoin will be
                    moving lower to make a correction soon!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       As a reminder, we suggest
                    that you deposit less than 10,000 per week into your accounts or just
                    spend the cash. Do not do something stupid and attract attention. Having
                    money comes responsibility. You can get really wealth very fast as many
                    of our customers have. If you are uncomfortable with getting stolen
                    cash then I suggest you at least pay off your debts so that you are not a
                    slave to the fucking banks.
       <br/>

       Please
                    be mindful of scam sites. There are many only use products from the
                    hidden wiki and make sure when you communicate with us its to our
                    cashgod@protonmail.com email address.

       I
                    dont know what Ace would say, but I suggest you dont deposit more than
                    5k in a 3 day period. I dont know how much you have but you dont want to
                    put attention on yourself. The law is 10k in any 24 hour period, but I
                    like to be conservative.

       Ok
                    I got the cash but I wish I had ordered weed instead. Cash cant make
                    you feel good like weed can. Whats better $500 weed or $2,500 cash? I
                    would rather have the weed right now. life sucks. Cash is fine though.

       Guys/Gals
                    not sure what you are. I did get my box of cash and it passed the
                    counterfeit tests I used. However, it was supposed to be overnight and
                    it took 3 days. Not sure why. I emailed about the issue and I never got a
                    response. I am considering another order but I hope the service is a
                    little bit better. The product is great.

       Less
                    than $3,000 in the ATM’s you might be able to do more but I am super
                    careful. If you keep your orders in a schedule you can easily deposit
                    enough that will show the large deposits as normal. I would only go
                    higher after than but never more than $10,000 in a week.

       How

                    much to deposit at one time in the ATM. Any feedback is appreciated.

       I
                    know you said not to use this cash for charity but I’ve been using it
                    to pay for respite care for a few old people in my community. I’ve been
                    spending most it on myself though, the extra goes to respite care to be
                    honest.

       I
                    dont think Bitcoin is going anywhere. It is a bunch of hype for
                    nothing. Though it is smart to get cash to keep in your house or some
                    place safe other than a bank. Governments all over the world are corrupt
                    and they play with your life savings like its a game.

       Is
                    Russia I hear black women are whores. Did you use whore money to pay
                    for first order now you have no more whore money? What you cost for a
                    few minutes?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Thank you very much

       Im
                    a little dissapointed. Why did you send me just 10s? It costs more to
                    ship a large box with all 10s. Do you not have any larger bills? It was a
                    little obnoxious if you ask me.

       Hy!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I
                    got my package yesterday from Fedex. I had it shipped right to my
                    house! Packaged from a well known ebay electronics vendor with that
                    vendors labeling. Opened the package to find a old school VHS player.
                    Inside the VHS player was $25,000. Excellent stealth overall. 50% $20’s,
                    50% $100’s.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Very pleased I will order again!

       I
                    will be ordering as soon as i get some bitcoin i am still very
                    skeptical about buying from the DW since i have been scammed like 5
                    times already but i really hope that cashgod is different but there
                    are so many good reviews on here that i am pretty sure they are legit
                    and are not going to disappoint fingers crossed i will update you guys
                    as soon as i make my first order!!!!

       You
                    guys are the best source to sell bitcoin to. Now that it is over 11k I
                    want to buy a few 50k packages. You have the cheapest money on that I
                    can find. Would you consider removing the 2 week requirement between
                    orders so that we take advantage of this current bitcoin market? It is
                    not going to last and this is a rare opportunity.

                    regular bi-weekly shipment list. Each shipment is 5,000 so my spending
                    money is as follows.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Monday – Thursday $250 per day
       <br/>
       Friday, Sat, Sun $500 per day
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Thanks
                    to you and the team Brad I can now put my entire paycheck (minus your
                    fee) in savings. This is more money than I have ever had. Its weird to
                    get used to.

       I put $1,000 into the offerings tray at church. Everyone saw how much I put in and they got to know I such a

       I’m
                    gonna keep putting $1,000 into the offerings tray each week until I am
                    100% sure everyone knows how good I am. Then I’m gonna finger-bang my
                    neighbors wife.

       I am a regular customer here and now get regular shipments every two weeks. It has changed my life.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The
                    real scammers are the government. Many countries used to be on the gold
                    standard. Meaning for every dollar printed the government held one
                    dollar worth of gold in its reserve. Now the government doesn’t use that
                    standard and they just print money with nothing backing it. A dollar
                    bill is worth a dollar only because the government says it is.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Guys
                    like cashgod are fucking around with their system. I am sure they
                    are going after them with everything they got with fake reviews and DOS
                    attacks etc. Of course they cant find them via tor so they do the next
                    best thing and try to scare people into not buying the pre shred cash.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Look
                    people the government has fucked us over and big banks and greedy
                    politicians have taken over by tweaking the system in their favor. The
                    team at cashgod has evened the score and let us have our money back.
                    The money belongs to the people. Plus, you could make much better use
                    of the money than your government.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Just my two micro bits for what its worth.

       Hello Good People
       <br/>
       <br/>
       It
                    has been a VERY busy week. Most people wanted overnight in time for
                    Black Friday. I assume to do holiday shopping in the USA. The orders
                    have brought our USD inventory down but we still have plenty for
                    additional orders. We also have refreshed our GBP inventory for our UK
                    clients.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Once again a reminder for international orders. You need
                    to tell us when you make your order that you want the cash shipped
                    internationally. Otherwise your quote will not be correct and IT WILL
                    DELAY YOUR SHIPMENT!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       As many of you know we have debated whether
                    or not to go private and stop accepting new orders. As opposed to doing
                    that we are going to change the Elite Program membership. We are only
                    going to be accepting a few new members and we are likely to be changing
                    our membership requirements, essentially making it more difficult to
                    join. Those changes will be announced in the next few weeks.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Last
                    thing, READ THE WEBSITE… We get lots of emails where people are asking
                    questions that are already answered on our website. We are going to stop
                    responding to those emails. This is cheap cash and a quick way to
                    really change your financial situation. Do yourself a favor and pay
                    attention. If we get one more email asking if this is counterfeit I am
                    going to puke! WE DO NOT DEAL IN COUNTERFEIT. ONLY REAL CASH!

       Sorry
                    Brad. I sent the extra bit coin as your requested for international
                    post. I will make sure to read the directions carefully for future
                    orders.

       It’s
                    been 6 weeks since I started ordering from Brad and I have yet be
                    disappointed with the process, I’ve ordered it 2 times so far. I dont
                    care if they are getting the cash from aliens, chinese, indians, the FED
                    or where ever else. This deposits into an ATM and bank tellers have no
                    problems with it. So I continue to buy. Thanks Brad!

       Hey
                    “looking for money” its legit but they sure do take a while. It
                    sometimes takes 24-48 hours for them to respond. Sometimes it takes 2
                    days to get their “Overnight” packages. Kind of shady if you ask me.
                    They should offer better service.

       Same
                    here. I read so much negative shit about this place but did a small
                    order anyway to see for myself. I never paid attention to the “fake
                    news” concept but now I believe it. I was told I was stupid and I would
                    not receive anything, and I was a sucker.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Well…..I did get a
                    box…. and $5,000 was inside a wrapped birthday present. It even had a
                    birthday card! So to the Law Enforcement pieces of shit who are posting
                    fake shit to scare people away. Fuck you! Just because you have a low
                    paying piece of shit job dont take away the ability for the rest of us
                    have some $$$

       Hey
                    Brad, I ordered the 1,300 on Oct 12th, then $10,000 on Nov 1st. I had
                    no issues with either order. If I do a youtube review can I get 10% off
                    of your pro package?

                    What’s going on man? I got a really beat to hell $10’s bill. Did I pay
                    for $590 or $600? Do the right thing and send me ANOTHER $10 bill man.

       I
                    am really happy I found this place. I paid for 10k. This will be a
                    great way to get my holiday shopping out of the way. My family is going
                    to have one hell of a holiday now. I hope it gets here before Friday.
                    10k can buy me a lot of deals.

       Is it possible to get 100.000 Euro? The 25.000 Euro package was very good and we would like to move to the next
                    level.

       I
                    am an EP member here and have buying Euros from them for awhile. My
                    recommendation is to not try to buy that much. Plus SW does not offer
                    that large of an amount as far as I know.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       EU regulators are
                    watching accounts also, not only in the USA. If you are depositing the
                    money keep the amounts low. If you are smart you can keep using this
                    resource and make a lot of money.

       this
                    is completely worth it in every way shape and form. After the first
                    package I am hooked and buy as much as I can every time. cashgod
                    takes 2+ days to ship sometimes longer so buy as much as you can. I also
                    think their going to get busted at some point. They also make you wait 2
                    weeks to order again. Booooooo!

                    anything that is not on their site. I tried to get like $500 and they
                    said no. Glad they passed on my offer. i grew some balls and got the
                    rooky. Got it in a DVD case. Titanic. The movie sucks.

                    THIS BUSINESS IS RUINING THE US ECONOMY? When cash that is marked for
                    shredding is reintroduced into the economy it devalues the US currency.
                    DO NOT BUY!!! DO NOT BUY!!! You are ruining the US Nation! They will
                    really send you money and it will slowly ruin this nation! I cant
                    believe this website exists. Only the government can save us now. I hope
                    the federal reserve catches you and STOPS YOU.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       YOU ARE RUINING THE ECONOMY WITH YOUR PRE-SHRED CASH. STOP
                    SENDING MONEY OUT. STOP IT STOP IT STOP IT.

       Got
                    my order in 2 days with the express shipping option. The packaging was
                    very clever, especially for big package. So far everything is working as
                    advertised.
       <br/>
       Got the $25,000 Package. No issues.

       placed
                    my order and got a tracking confirmation 10 hours later. kind of slow
                    response time right? followed the tracking until it showed up today. I
                    ordered the $5,000 package and he gave me $5,500 which is nice. “Brad”
                    with cashgod makes lots of stupid jokes but i got my cash. he can
                    keep his jokes to himself in the future. just keep sending me the money
                    and shut the hell up

       I
                    am not sure the requirements now, it used to be 10k package or higher
                    then 2 weeks after delivery you can sign up for the regular shipments.
                    There is usually a nice discount. I got in early, so I dont think the
                    same terms apply.

       These
                    guys have been good to me. I live in Mexico but I drive over the
                    boarder to my UPS store mailbox and pick up my delivery. The best part
                    is the money is real and I can spend it with no problems.

       Fedex
                    finally showed up this morning. I ordered overnight last Monday!!!!!
                    Shitty service for stolen cash. IDK if I am ordering again.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I know there are tons of positive reviews and
                    happy customers but my experience so far has not been so good.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       They probably wont post this. Lets see.

       Thanks for the updates as always Brad. Maybe now is a good time to go private and just work with your high end
                    clients?

       Hi Guys/Gals
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Finally
                    some good news for our European clients, we made a deal with our
                    “vendor” so the Euro inventory will be going back up. I know many of you
                    were waiting until that issue was resolved before ordering. Order up we
                    are ready for you.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Fucking scammers are out in full force now as
                    we head into the USA holiday season. We are seeing more clones then
                    ever. We have evidence that a large amount of it is state sponsored but
                    there are a few script kiddies out there looking for quick cash.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       BE
                    CAREFUL and make sure that every page you are on is cashgod
                    http://cashgodplzcfmasy.onion Some of the script kiddies out there are
                    not even bothering to change the site just the email address. Only send
                    emails to cashgod@protonmail.com anywhere else and you are NOT
                    TALKING TO US.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       We are working hard to take down clones. We have
                    code that has worked well in helping us identify people who steal our
                    site. We already found one dickhead in India. Dont worry we left him
                    alone but his family ran into some problems. Lets just say he is done
                    fucking around with us.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I am getting a lot of questions about how
                    we get our cash and how to use it. All of these questions are answered
                    on our site. Its easy money people READ READ READ. Dont be lazy!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       A
                    few final thoughts…………… The US elections have brought to light the use
                    of state sponsored misinformation “Fake News” this is something most of
                    us in the darknet knew about for years. I can tell you personally that
                    gov agencies are trying VERY VERY HARD to bring us down but the
                    technology makes it difficult for them. They use “Fake News” to sour our
                    reputation and now they are stepping up clones and screwing over our
                    customers in order to discredit us. We will not let it stop us!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Our
                    goal since day 1 has been clear. The 1% has taken advantage of us for
                    too long. Now the 99% is getting their deserved share. Get yours.
                    Nothing good lasts forever. Do not miss out, but be cautious.
       <br/>

       I
                    really do not recommend this place. It is evil. They sent me 5 grand
                    and I used it to pay off a debt. Now all I do is feel guilty that I
                    bought stolen money. Even if it is from the gov like they say.

                    had even a twinge of interest in extra cash and breaking free of the
                    rat race, I highly recommend you order this product. cashgod is very
                    generous in their offer. BRAVA, cashgod. Outta the park!

                    is the first time I have ever done something like this but I am glad I
                    did. I ordered on Sunday &amp; bought the $1300 deal. It arrived today
                    with all hundred dollar bills. Like others have said they are used but
                    no different than bills you would get from the bank.

       I
                    am HIGHLY skeptical!!! I got the $1,300 cash package but I straight up
                    think its drug money because its in GOOD shape. I thought this was cash
                    selected for disposal? The cash works in ATM’s but I think there is
                    something very fishy going on. personally I think these guys may be the
                    Chinese trying to destroy the USD.

      <p>
       Single
                    dad here with 2 very young children. This seems like a dream come true
                    to fix my immediate financial issues. But as a single father it’s scary
                    to do something like this because if I were to get into trouble… I worry
                    about my kids. But really, it just seems like selling bitcoin for more
                    than the going price. And there is no law against that, only that we are
                    knowingly receiving stolen property.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       If they setup a second,
                    fake website that doesn’t say the money is stolen, it could just be a
                    front saying that they buy bitcoins for above market value, then anyone
                    caught could say they were just selling bitcoins on this website that
                    shows nothing about it being stolen. Just an idea.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The casino
                    idea is great. Just put a hundred or so into a machine, play a few
                    spins, print your ticket, go to another machine, repeat.. At the end, go
                    to one of the atm’s that take your tickets and cash out. So you may
                    lose $50 out of $1000, still making a profit and still getting back
                    fresh bills to ease your mind about putting them in the bank. Not to
                    mention the slot machines are a great test of the bills to show they are
                    real.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Anyway, I am going to give it a shot and just buy the $350
                    package and see how it goes. If it goes well, i’ll wait the 2 weeks and
                    grab the big package (not my dick), and fix all my financial problems.

       The box was sitting at my front door when I came home from work today. Like others have said it is a nice

       Took
                    my cash deposited it at the bank and used my debit card for 2 tickets
                    from USA to London, hotel and tube passes. My boyfriend and I have never
                    been out of the country before. We are excited.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The bank had no
                    issues depositing the money and I had instant access to it through my
                    debit card. The teller even gave me a lollipop.

       Ok, I received my first shipment from these guys. Here is my review.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Order: $10,000 Express Shipping
       <br/>
       Paid:
                    $1,250 (Paid in Equivalent Bitcoin)
       <br/>
       Tracking Received: 18 Hours (I did order on a Sunday)
       <br/>
       Package Delivered:
                    4 days from payment
       <br/>
       Shipping Method: Fedex
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Shipping Quality: Standard. Used DVD Cases with Cash Inside.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Product
                    Quality: Real USA notes 100 &amp; 20. Pen tested and pro-grade machine counter with counterfeit detection
                    capability
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Overall
                    Review: Not bad. These guys definitely got their hands on real cash. I
                    can see no reason not to be able to spend it or deposit it as they
                    described. Though I have not deposited the money at a bank. I have no
                    intention of doing so.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Vendor Rating: B
       <br/>
       Reason: They ship what
                    they advertise and the stealth shipping method is good. Product was
                    delivered on time, but email response can be slow. Otherwise they would
                    have earned an A.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I hope this helps.

       What

                    more Euros this week? I want to make a large order and ensure it
                    arrives promptly.

                    just thought it would come monday. I guess i spaced it when I looked at
                    the tracking. It was a $2,500 package the bills are in “Good” condition,
                    spendable but not new and crisp.

       That’s
                    the truth Brad! Fucking Europeans they just want to take take take. I
                    hope it works out. The government is in full blown denial now. We now
                    have proof Russia was putting out all kinds of fake news on twitter and
                    Facebook. Its all a bunch of bullshit! The government does the same shit
                    with SW, lot of “unhappy customers”. What bull shit is that. This place
                    has changed the way I live and a few others I know. Just another reason
                    to go private Brad. I have been pushing for it for quite awhile now.
                    Why deal with all the fake bullshit. Fake News, Fake Reviews, the
                    government stooges are going to do all they can to stop you from giving
                    out the stolen pre-shred cash. They are the fucking crooks and they know
                    it. God bless TOR it works and keeps those greedy bastards at bay!

       Guys/Gals
       <br/>
       <br/>
       It
                    has been a VERY BUSY week. I am happy to announce that our new supplier
                    of GBP got a really good exchange rate to replenish our GBP inventory.
                    We have had lots of happy “mates” who have or will soon be getting some
                    well reserved cash. Are you?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       As always I like to be transparent
                    with you on the business front. Our supplier in Europe wants to
                    renegotiate our agreement early and has decided to go on strike until we
                    work it out. They have agreed to ship out the existing inventory but
                    they will not exchange our USD for Euro until we agree on new terms. I
                    am pissed beyond belief but we will work it out. No honor among thieves!
                    That is the lesson of the day. As soon as I have an update I will let
                    you know. In the meantime, I updated our inventory for Euro to low just
                    to be cautious.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       A few other notes… USA clients make sure you are
                    not depositing more than $10,000 at any one time. Do NOT go to different
                    banks to make smaller deposits, you will still get flagged for the
                    deposits since the fucking government tracks by ss#. We did have one
                    client email us that he screwed up and now he got an letter from the
                    State because of back child support. Look, if you are not used to having
                    money then you need to get smart quick. Being wealthy is NOT easy.
                    Everyone including the government is going to want a piece. Dont be
                    stingy but dont be cheap either!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Enjoy the week and the cash! Fuck the Government Crooks!!!!
       <br/>

       I
                    was skeptical also I finally did it though. I guess I am just a sucker
                    for easy cash. It did work its real cash like they claim. BTW.. I order
                    in the UK. I’m a USA expat.

       Hi
                    all, just testing if this is legit. Is there anyone from uk who has
                    ordered? These get rich quick things have never really worked for me so I
                    don’t want to lose what little I have. If I loose or get scammed, this
                    would really put me in the mud so I’m looking to see how many would
                    respond to get an idea if this is legit. I apologise if this is
                    offensive but it would reassure me to order. Thanks
      </p>

       I
                    know it sounds too good to be true…. and I thought the same way until I
                    tried it. This is the real deal! The cash is confirmed legit and not
                    counterfeit. That is a big deal because these guys are the only ones
                    SELLING REAL CASH.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I received my first order last week. Unfortunately, they make you wait between orders
                    for 2 weeks.

       Good
                    product for the money. Easy to spend and deposit, a decent vendor. The
                    website is a little weak. The response time is slow. It does not appear
                    brand new.
       <br/>
       Avoid the temptation to spend all the money at once. They
                    seriously will only send you 1 order every 2 weeks. it is a real pain
                    waiting around until you can order again. I got it right away with
                    overnight shipping. Why only 4 of 5 stars? slow response time.

       Why
                    is it when a customer asks for special amount of bills and doesn’t get
                    it? I asked for all 100’s and you send me all 20’s. The package could
                    have been so much smaller if you used all 100’s like I asked.

       Hi
                    guys, i want to order, but i am very skeptical, because i never bought
                    something from dark net… this sounds too nice to be true. Sometimes i
                    think the owner of this page write the positive comments by their own.
                    Dont know, so can anyone help? :)… If I order and i am wrong or my
                    thoughts were wrong, I will apologize Brad. We all need money, but real
                    money for less money sounds too good…

       How
                    often do you ship down under? I have read some of the reviews and did
                    some research on you with some trusted sources from other Aussies and
                    say its real. How are those clients exchanging the USD or Euro?

       cashgod was the first purchase I ever made on the dark web. I am glad I
                    did it. Of course that gave me the confidence to order other things from
                    other vendors and I got screwed. Go figure.
       <br/>
       cashgod has been fantastic. Keep up the fight Brad we need you!

                    suggest anyone outside the USA use local currency exchange places. They
                    ask very little questions and if you exchange a few thousand at a time
                    you stay under the radar. I have exchanged $25,000 and spread it out
                    over 6 different locations.

       SW
                    has changed me! I used the “product” at the casino to beef up my bank
                    roll at the tables, then I cash out with new bills. Plus it does not
                    sting as bad when I lose.

       That
                    is a really good idea. I have been watching this site for a few weeks
                    now deciding on whether or not to go ahead and buy. I like your idea on
                    using the casino to exchange your money. Plus I could play at much
                    higher levels and do some serious WINNING!
       <br/>
       Ill start with the Basic and see what happens.

       Well
                    stated… I think the more information about JFK will show how corrupt
                    and crazy our govt is. Governments get away with all kinds of crazy plus
                    the amount of money out their in the system is beyond comprehension.

       OK
                    people i forgot too mention that as Americans we were raised too be
                    good Americans By being patriotic do not question the government go too
                    school get a education get a job and be a slave too the system give them
                    your tax dollars and remain silent sit on the sidelines while they
                    continue too fuck you and not use any Lubrication Look i tell it like it
                    is our government has been robbing us blind stealing and getting filthy
                    rich while selling this nation out too foreign countries mean while you
                    are expected too be a Law Abiding citizen Ron Paul had a plaque on his
                    desk that said don’t steal from the government they hate competition the
                    truth is that by buying this awesome pre shred which i Eagerly await in
                    the mail BTW you are taking back what our Quasi government has been
                    withholding where was the peoples bailout i ask well by buying this Pre
                    shred you are giving yourself a bailout of your own now Brad i told you
                    i would write this too inform all your customers and too inform all
                    those who are still too afraid too order pre shred The government
                    expects us all too turn a blind eye while they steal cheat and rob us
                    blind and misrepresent us i say fuck the non federal non reserve and
                    their bought and paid for politicians they are the most evil
                    organization of greedy crooks / bankers they own the media Hollywood
                    politicians the supreme court their is no Limit to their ability too
                    corrupt every single facet of society and concerning the euro dollar the
                    very same bankers needed a way too control the currency of Europe they
                    knew that if all the European nations had their own currency they could
                    not control the money supply in Europe it had nothing too do with the
                    complicated exchange rates they want you too think that so you can sleep
                    better and not know the truth that they are in control of the worlds
                    different currencies the non federal non reserve was the result of a
                    meeting in the year 1913 on Jekyll island Georgia than president Woodrow
                    wilson signed the federal reserve act and afterwards he admitted that
                    he knowingly doomed future Americans and their financial stability you
                    see when Woodrow Wilson was a professor she had a affair and the powers
                    that be behind the federal reserve blackmailed him afraid of his affair
                    being exposed Wilson agreed and signed the federal reserve act into law
                    and it passed with only 4 votes because all other senators congressmen
                    were back in their home states during Christmas break now the point of
                    this post is too educate and inform those who think its UN American to
                    give cashgod business you are entitled too your share of this money
                    and it is yours its mine these crooked fucks in power are lining their
                    damn pockets and expecting you too think and believe its wrong too buy
                    from cashgod as i said and as the admin says its yours take it back
                    but spend carefully don,t deposit more than 10 K DON’T ATTRACT ATTENTION
                    TOO YOURSELF the government wants Too keep you under their control And
                    In Debt and dependent on them as for me i Am going too Tell them too
                    fuck off while i hopefully enjoy some high quality Pre Shred The
                    government is not your friend they are your enemy they don’t care about
                    you they care about how they can fuck you over and make you think they
                    are doing it for your own good and too the people who say that buying
                    this money is taking away from peoples retirement that’s bullshit when
                    you go to the bank and cash your retirement check you sure as hell don’t
                    receive Pre Shred Cash no you get newer currency And remember the
                    American Dream is Another lie too make you work harder too make someone
                    Else Rich you can only dream while your sleeping Bye For Now People JFK

       I
                    am getting a lot on enquirers in the Elite Program about adding a 100k
                    option. We have not made a final determination on that yet. Our main
                    goal is to ensure we have enough cash on hand to fill the orders.

       Remember everyone deserves a change to fuck

                    help those of us who move larger volumes.

       I agree wit Cage on this one Brad. We need to get the EP program members a 100k option. Any timeline on when

       This

                    that do. We worked with another organization but the product and
                    delivery are much better here.

       You
                    said that if you ship late I would get 5% extra but I dont see it. I
                    bought 10k and only received 10k. It was two days late. What is going on
                    I should have had an extra 1k inside.

       Add
                    me to the list of happy clients in the UK. The new vendor you guys have
                    is going a really good job. Fast, and the notes are perfect.

       I
                    was reading the reviews here and on some other sites and there are
                    other people who were getting the cash inside adult toys or other
                    things. I am putting in my 0.00002 btc and also want to urge you to stop
                    doing it. My first shipment from you guys was inside a adult toy. I
                    understand the need for stealth but I am sure there are other choices.

       I
                    am noticing a lot of very happy people here but my experience was not
                    so good. Both times I have ordered the package has come late and there
                    was no extra cash inside. I thought if your parcel is late you receive
                    extra money?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I also want to know why my orders keep getting screwed up. Its apparent not everyone has the
                    same problem(s) that I have.

                    Between the IRS and other government watch dogs there is no such thing

       Oh
                    federal government please take care of me. Give me hand outs and pay
                    the top 1% everything our country has. I have simple needs, only some
                    food, and some water here and there. I dont need healthcare, a job, a
                    roof over my head. Please make sure you print more money and inject into
                    the stock market. The top 1% needs more profits, dont disappoint them
                    with a low bonus. 10 million vs 50 million dollar bonus is a big deal.
                    You can tax me more if that helps. I just want to do my part.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Thank you government of all you do to keep me
                    from being more than I can be!

       Reminder.
                    If you want international shipping you must tell us when you send an
                    email for the quote. This way you get a correct bitcoin quote. Otherwise
                    we will be holding your shipment until you pay the balance.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Follow directions! It is easy to do.

       My
                    experience here was bittersweet. I bought to Professional for $10k and
                    everything went ok. I deposited it the bank and a few days later I get a
                    letter from the state that they were notified of unusual deposit
                    history from my bank. The bastards are all over me for back child
                    support and now its frozen and they are likely going to just take it.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       My
                    suggestion is to not bother depositing the money and only spend it as
                    cash. Especially if you are in the same situation as I am with child
                    support.

       Be careful with child support. The government is no joke with that stuff. Use the cash and keep it out of the
                    bank!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The good news is a few orders more and you will probably be able to pay off the back child support.

                    take you back to court and try to bleed more our of you. Then you really
                    have problems because the court is going to want to see where the extra

       Our
                    government is absolutely a mess. Its run by big bankers that build a
                    business on taking more and more from us. I work construction on road
                    projects all day in the hot sun 8-10 hours every day plus I have a 1
                    hour commute. Now many of the bankers make millions a day just pushing
                    buttons a computer. They barely break a sweat.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The fact SW is out
                    there trying to equalize the gap is a good thing. You have my support.
                    Plus I like getting cash every month. Its more than I will ever make and
                    I looking forward to quitting my day job after a few more shipments.

       Why
                    do you have a once per month policy? I want to order more cash too. It
                    seems like others want the policy changed also. It might be a good idea
                    to let us order earlier.

       I
                    was skeptical also, even after I got my first order. It wasnt until
                    around the 3rd shipment that I finally realized I am not dreaming and
                    now I need a plan on how to deal with a large amount of cash. Its more
                    money than I ever had in my life.

                    they wont let me and said I have to wait 2 weeks before I put in another
                    order, which kinda sucks.

       I
                    did one order for $1300. I got in 3 days and they were all 100 bills.
                    The money did not look too bad IMO. I spent it. I am waiting to order
                    again. They make you wait 2 weeks for some reason.

                    and keeping some cash in a safe. I have Euro but I also want to hold
                    some USD. Can I order USD and have it sent to a location within the EU
                    or am I better off just ordering more Euro?

       JOE,
                    very good points. No one said it was easy in the darknet. Im still
                    using my cash from here to buy gold and bitcoin, but mostly gold. The
                    world is going into the shitter. I dont want to left holding a bag of
                    worthless paper money, plus if we lose power and technology bitcoin will
                    be worthless. That leaves good ole shinny gold. Its always had value
                    and always will.

       Those
                    of you who have been around SW for while know me. I have been saying to
                    be careful of the type of research you do about darknet sites. Reddit,
                    Google, YouTube, are NOT credible resources. LE and even larger groups
                    like our family at Christians in Action are responsible for a
                    considerable amount of Psych Ops against illegal operations.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Hansa
                    Market is a good example, once compromised by the Dutch government
                    several thousand positive fake reviews went up everywhere (Reddit,
                    Google, YouTube, etc) Then they sat back and recorded everything that
                    took place and several of the vendors went down hard. Marketplaces are
                    not as safe as everyone touts them to be and many legit independents
                    (like cashgod) are known by the true players in the darknet. I say
                    this again as a reminder, negative reviews of a website mean nothing.
                    Its the sites with many positive reviews or none at all that should
                    concern you, especially if they are for illegal activities but posted on
                    clearnet sites like Google ,YouTube, and unfortunately now even Reddit.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Rule
                    #1 of true darknet proprietors is that you dont advertise in the
                    clearnet, ever. It compromises anonymity. Plus true darknet vendors, at
                    least ones worth doing business with, have established customers and do
                    not need to “advertise” in the traditional sense of the word. Their
                    marketing is usually tied to word of mouth advertising or chain
                    messaging on trusted relay points like THW (the real one
                    zqktlwi4fecvo6ri.onion) and they usually change onion addresses and
                    servers on a regular basis for security reasons.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Take a look…. Its about this topic but focuses on Opioid
                    sales but the practice is know to be used in all areas.

       Be
                    careful!!! Like some others that commented here I was scammed by clones
                    as well. cashgod is pretty famous in the underground world but as a
                    noob I didnt know any better.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Brad and his team are fantastic.
                    They helped me overcome my fear and distrust since getting screwed twice
                    before with cloned sites. I did my homework this time and researched
                    with TRUSTED darkweb veterans who know what is what around here and they
                    gave me the correct
       <a href="http://cashgodplzcfmasy.onion/">
        http://cashgodplzcfmasy.onion
       </a>
       cashgod address. I have made sure to keep this link bookmarked so
                    that I am not fooled again. There are so many clones out their its hard
                    to know what is real or not. All I can tell you is do your research
                    (which is hard) with people who REALLY KNOW the darkweb. Its not as easy
                    as it seems.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       BTW.. the money you get from these guys is not
                    counterfeit. It is real cash, like others I tested it for counterfeit
                    and used a pro grade counter, every bill passed and as others have
                    commented their stealth shipping is insane!
       <br/>
       <br/>

       Guys &amp; Gals
       <br/>
       We
                    had a very HEALTHY USD delivery and our inventory levels are solid! I
                    know a few of you had to wait for your orders to process due to the
                    inventory delay, thank you for your patience &amp; look for a little
                    extra in your boxes.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       We had a HUGE demand for GBP since our
                    announcement to resume GBP orders. Thank you to all of our customers new
                    &amp; existing in the UK! We are here for you! Remember, its not the
                    ERII’s money ITS YOURS take it back!
       <br/>

       Very
                    nice! This is a really good service you guys are providing. I was a
                    first time customer and I am really looking forward to making my next
                    purchase with you. I have to admit I was skeptical too but when I spent
                    the first $100 bill I was hooked.

       As
                    I sit here I wonder to myself, why did I buy this Stack? Because I need
                    money and this provides it for me. This is hands-down the easiest money
                    I have ever made. I thought about buying counterfeit a few years ago,
                    and just didn’t, but I’m glad I bought this pre-shred. it worked
                    perfectly.

       I
                    checked the site of the so called "Cash Lords" - they aren't americans
                    they are germans or so. Not very professional. Their poorly build
                    Wordpress Site do have a Order structure with german words. So what
                    ever. Just another attempt to fuck with the cashgod. It wouldn't be very
                    hard to get this site down. But yeah, like I say live-and-let-live. What
                    cashgod will do to solve this problem is up to them.

       WARNING–This
                    will probably be an odd post but I hope these guys approve it. Here is
                    my story, I have been using this group to get cash for a around a month.
                    I used the cash to pay off my credit cards. I am debt free which is
                    nice and I am not complaining.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       BUT– You will get addicted to the
                    money. I have already noticed my spending is WAY UP from what I used to
                    do. I understand now what people say that money does not make you happy.
                    I need to reign in my spending again. I was addicted to the credit
                    cards before now its the cash. Either way I was addicted. I need to kick
                    the habit and spend like a normal human being.

       Good
                    news for our “Mates” across the pond! We have secured a new source for
                    GBP within the UK and received confirmation that inventory is in place .
                    For our UK clients, current and new, thank you for your patience as we
                    secured a new contractor to handle our “currency needs”. You are free to
                    start your GBP orders. Orders today will go out as early as tomorrow.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       On
                    a separate note USD inventory is low. For whatever reason we received
                    several large orders over the past few days. Those are shipping out
                    today. Unfortunately it placed a strain on USD inventory, however we are
                    expecting more USD later this week. Until then all USD orders will be
                    processed in the order they are received. For our Elite Program clients
                    there will be no issues with your regular bi-weekly delivery. Your cash
                    has already been moved aside to fill your orders.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       If you are
                    waiting on tax reform or thinking your government is going to fix things
                    dont hold your breath. I can tell you they are so screwed up nothing
                    will change. We built an entire business on their lack of discipline and
                    poor controls. The money belongs to the people the government took it
                    from. The Federal Reserve is a fraud.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Spend Wisely My Friends!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Fuck the Government Brad

       Nope.
                    But that is not unusual, there have been several attempts where people
                    cloned this site and try to screw cashgod customers. There was one a
                    few weeks ago and I feel sorry for that poor bastard who cloned this
                    site. I know they found out who the guy was who did it. Some Arab or
                    something. All I know is I would not want to be that shit head. These
                    guys don’t take lightly to people stealing their shit.

       Ordered
                    and paid plus overnight shipping for my man on Touesday.. Order arrived
                    on Friday. Again not exactly overnight and my man was a little pissed.
                    The cash looked only slightly used, 10k mostly 20s,50s,100s.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I would do it again but not order overnight.
                    Why bother. I dont want to catch another beating for being late.

       We ship worldwide with the exception of Cuba and North Korea.
       <br/>
       Also,
                    a note regarding our international orders. You must tell us that the
                    shipment is international when you request your quote. All orders not
                    shipped to a EU address is an international order. If you dont tell us
                    we do not add it to your quote. When you send payment then tell us you
                    want it sent internationally we can not ship until you pay the
                    international shipping.
       <br/>
       This has been happening a lot lately and it
                    delays your shipment. I want these orders to be shipped within 24 hours
                    but we cant do that if you do not pay for international shipping
                    upfront.

       I
                    would suggest you tell them with your order not to ship your cash
                    inside sex toys. I finished my first order with them and the money was
                    inside a very large black dildo. I am not into dicks especially black
                    ones. I wont even touch black women.

       Someone
                    made a clone of your site. I looked at the pictures
                    and analyzed them. I work in forensics BTW. I noticed that the pics of
                    the cash they used was exactly like yours but they photo-shopped the
                    onion address. You can tell because when you blow up the pic you can see
                    the distortion in the crease of the paper when they replaced your onion
                    address with theirs. Amateurs!
       <br/>
       I have ordered twice now and enjoy
                    your service. I hope that this info was useful to you, but you probably
                    already knew about it.

       This
                    review is more on the packaging than the Euro, which itself is very
                    good and an excellent value. It’s very easy to spend, and the only thing
                    I had trouble with so far is unpacking the Euro from the very strong
                    packaging. I needed a knife to open it, but I cut some of the bills.
                    Very unfortunate

       Since
                    the beginning of this year, I’ve been wanting to try this cash. As
                    usual, I spent around 2 weeks thinking about it before I spent any
                    money. After placing my order the package came with a great speed and
                    low price. Absolutely love it, because it is so simply, and it gives you
                    the feel of being rich.
       <br/>
       The pros in this product were: Low Price, fast shipping.
       <br/>
       The negatives are: having

       Having
                    worked in the banking industry for years now, I’ve seen scores of money
                    making methods come and go. Until now, nobody quite got it right and
                    everyone was trying to fuck you over. In the cashgod method, they
                    have created a near perfect blend of ease and security. I’ve been using
                    them for months now – keep it up!

       Had
                    high hopes, but simply not ready for prime time. I prefer hiding my
                    face at ATM’s and using stolen credit cards. ALot more risk but I just
                    prefer the thrill of taking the last $50 out of some old grandma’s
                    account.

       I
                    would suggest you pay attention to what Brad and the admins say here.
                    Do not deposit more than 10k at one time. Otherwise you are asking for
                    trouble. Plus if you have an average daily balance in your account of
                    something like $1000 then depositing 25k at one time is going to raise
                    some concerns.
       <br/>
       Stay off their radar!

                    the deposit. Is there anything special I should do? Its mostly 100’s and
                    20’s. That wont raise any suspision will it?

       nice

       Not brand new cash – but for the small price its great, along with a few extra $20’s. It’s well worth the price.

       This
                    is honestly a great deal BUT you have to watch out for slow shipping.
                    Nice low price for cash. cash came looking fresh and smelling decent. No
                    factory mistakes or pen marks. The box was a little damaged because of
                    the USPS shipping option, but I love the free shipping options. Expect
                    2-4 days for the 2-3 day shipping. Been 6 days since I got my last
                    order. I hate their rule of &gt;only 1 order per month&lt;.

                    Cash Company they fucked me over. Brad not only apologized even though
                    it wasnt his fault. Brad sent the cash and added $1300 to my order to
                    cover my loses.

       <br/>
       The other
                    posters are correct look at every link and every page. Make sure you are

       never
                    bought from you guys before, however i’ve been lurking in the comments
                    since june of this year. i still don’t have enough money to buy a
                    package, so if you guys decide to go private, i hope there’s a chance
                    for people like me to get into &gt;the family.&lt;
       <br/>
       <br/>
       if you do go
                    private, i agree with the other user who suggested a method of using a
                    basic website, and offering one package size for outsiders. best wishes

       I
                    think it’s a good idea in the long term Brad. In my opinion it would
                    be cool to give new people a little time to try it out first, or only
                    offer one package size to non members and make it more
                    complicated/anonymous. Example – have the orders pre-packed (don’t give
                    them selection to choose note type) and just have a basic webpage layout
                    for non members. That way only members can see the process of how the
                    money is obtained (though most already know).
       <br/>
       <br/>
       So maybe switch to
                    an invite only service in the future for new customers but if you ever
                    need to re-open or want to expand you could always remove the invite
                    code.

                    I must say I think for the safety of you a and your organization, as
                    well as to keep helping the community you already have: without getting
                    to the point where you start getting huge fed attention – it’s probably a
                    good idea. I’m new here just placed my first order and hope I can be
                    part of the family. If you decide to go private, I sincerely hope you
                    give the people (like me) who just found this place the opportunity to
                    do business and would like to be a part of the club =).
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I used to
                    know people in the online AAS community (steroid/anabolics online
                    vendors) and I know how the top vendors got shutdown. I also know the
                    ones who are still operating to this day and have been for many years
                    (10+ yrs). I’ll send an email if you’d like some tips please read I’ll
                    email you shorty – titan3

       As
                    soon as I got this cash in the mail I went straight to the an ATM and
                    made a deposit. It fucking worked. Im going hiking soon and going to buy
                    alot of high end higher gear. I think the most state of the art hiking
                    boots dramatically improve endurance correct? ANyhow If I die on my hike
                    I’ve given instructions to leave a bad review on this site.

       Brad I took your idea of using Visa gift cards.
       <br/>
       Everyone
                    its simple and the clerks at these drug stores don’t give a shit! Take
                    $500 of the cash and buy gift cards. I went to 5 stores and spent my
                    money. Now I can purchase what I want and not worry about anything.

       I
                    did business with these guys in July buying the Basic pack. I thought
                    for sure they would be shut down. The money was the real deal. I order
                    the Pro pack for next week. Still nervous about it I dont want to press
                    my luck.

       First order here. Anyways testing to see if my comment posts again I’m super excited !!
       <br/>
       Tips
                    on how to spend money. Never deposit more than 10k at a bank but in all
                    honesty even if you deposit less you might still cause the bank to be
                    suspicious. Depending on your income and bank size of course. But I’d
                    personally stick to using the cash primarily for gas, groceries, and
                    other necessities. Give to family in small amounts and donate to
                    charities =) make the world a better place. If we all spent even just a
                    small percentage of our income giving to others – it would make a huge
                    impact on people of the world. That’s my goal in life. My goal isn’t to
                    have a mansion and Ferrari’s. I just want to help others. Of course
                    having a steady home and wealth for rainy days is nice, but eventually
                    I’ll work up to that.
       <br/>
       Advice – buy a non suspicious car such as a few
                    years old Hyundai or Toyota or truck/suv. Don’t try to buy anything
                    worth more than a few grand with cash at a time. Build a small business
                    (ebay/amazon/pizzeria/carwash etc) generate a legitimate income source.
                    Pay your taxes. Don’t go from 35k a year to 200k a year. Slowly work
                    your way up. Report bitcoin income to IRS. try to make as many
                    deductions as possible (this will make you look like you are trying to
                    save/make more money, not hide/launder).
       <br/>
       Take your time with your
                    business and work on side projects that will be legitimate deposits to
                    your bank without raising any eyebrows by the gov.
       <br/>
       Get burner laptops and phones!! Never use same aliases or
                    real phone # with darkweb. Be smart and cautious!!

       Package
                    is here but it smells like fish or something. Where you do you keep the
                    money? My package of 5k was mostly 20s and 100s. Decent condition. Like
                    others have said the bills are worn down some have stamps from
                    different places, some have writing. There are a few of the 100s that
                    are torn alot of them are 96 series bills that were going to be traded
                    out I would imagine.
       <br/>
       Overall I am happy with the experience. I will order again.

                    yesterday. I am excited too.

       I
                    made my order today. Id say they are a little slow on emails but they
                    are helpful none the less. Make sure you guys compensate the 2.5% from
                    Helix. I went a little short the first time I tried paying. Thankfully
                    they were understanding and let me send the remaining amount to another
                    address. Will be updating as the process goes on. waiting on my
                    confirmation and tracking number now.

       I
                    know it sounds too good to be true…. and I thought the same way until I
                    tried it. This is the real deal! The cash is confirmed legit and not
                    counterfeit. That is a big deal because these guys are the only ones
                    SELLING REAL CASH.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I received my first order last week. Unfortunately, they make you wait between orders
                    for a month.

                    shopping mall. Never have to take it in the ass for less anymore. I

       I
                    thought you had screwed me when I only saw $1500 but order $2500. Then I
                    looked under the packaging and noticed the other $1000 was there. You
                    did a good job hiding it. I almost didnt even find it!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I suggest some instructions on where to find the
                    money inside the package. Its not so obvious to us noobs!

                    are taken care of. The government is once again fucking everyone over.
                    There will be NO TAX REFORM, only breaks for the big companies and
                    special interests. This is the only place were the everyone can get a
                    piece of the action and get the money the rightfully deserve. Keep my bi
                    weekly packages coming……. Its getting real shitty out there!

       Guys
                    I am happy to see you are under new management. Things were getting a

       Good
                    product for the money. Easy to spend and deposit, a decent vendor. The
                    website is a little weak. The response time is slow. It does not appear
                    brand new.
       <br/>
       Avoid the temptation to spend all the money at once. They
                    seriously will only send you 1 order per month. it is a real pain
                    waiting around until you can order again. I got it right away with
                    overnight shipping. Why only 4 of 5 stars? slow response time.

       Brad is highly professional, knowledgeable about this work and
                    deadline focused. The cash delivery was on time and they are easy to
                    work with. I think he could improve on responding to messages faster. I
                    will definitely order with cashgod in the future. Only good things
                    to say!

                    $50’s. I said very clear statement to ONLY send $20’s. Very clear in

       Completely
                    meets my expectations. It remains to be seen how long I will be able to
                    order cash from this group. the cash does not concern me, they sell
                    alot and I trust them. The only other thing I would have like to see is
                    different packing options. Like being able to have the cash packaged
                    inside of a fishing rod or something. I will update if I notice any
                    issues spending the money.

       I
                    love money. Love. I would rather have money than sex. I bought this as a
                    treat for myself. Skillfully hid the box from my husband and children
                    when they were delivered today. Could not wait for them to get in bed
                    fast enough. Opened it up…and i felt like I was floating on clouds I was
                    so happy. I pull out a few $100’s, rub them over my body and it’s
                    orgasmic. I’m so sad b/c I was looking forward to ordering a big package
                    this week but I realized they have a limit on 1 shipment per month

       My

                    is on time and the customer support is top notch. We couldn’t get
                    through Spring without it, and it also helps me buy stuff my kids are

       I
                    purchased this cash for my wife for an upcoming backpacking trip
                    through Yosemite. Having a brother order alot of cash several weeks
                    previously, I knew the quality. Needless to say the cash lived up to my
                    expectations and exceeded them. The feel in hand is excellent and it
                    spends very well

                    shipped but it never went out. We paid for overnight shipping our self
                    to make it right. You’ll have it tomorrow and tracking information is in

       I
                    am the most paranoid to order, I have lost so much money all over DW
                    from counterfeit services and I have found this site and been watching
                    for a few months but I am so nervous about losing anymore money. I hope
                    this is legit because it could really help me. Jeff I will hopefully
                    make order within the week bro

       I
                    asked the manager at my bank if I could make a large cash deposit. I
                    told her it was from a great aunt who passed and kept cash in her
                    mattress. I told her it was around $25,000. The bank manager said it was
                    no problem!
       <br/>
       Do you think its OK to deposit the entire $25,000?

       Jeff,
                    Im ex-military and found your site while I am stationed in Japan. I
                    wanted to let your visitors from Japan know that ordering from you guys
                    was a breeze. USD arrived with no issue. Box was not opened by customs.
                    Exchange to Yen was easy and no trouble.

      <p>
       So
                    to start this review off, This cash is definitely not remotely as crisp
                    and brand new as the photos show. I would say they are all &gt;B&lt;
                    quality. That was a main concern for me before I bought this cash. Now
                    there was a lot of positive review for this organization when I was
                    considering buying from them, so I figured I would give it a shot;
                    especially since it is for a good price and has free shipping.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I’ve
                    ordered a few packages and they can be very tightly packaged or pretty
                    large, depending on what you request. Not many people realize you can
                    tell them how big of a package you want your cash to be packed in but
                    you can. the cash comes vacuum sealed and double bagged. Vacuum sealed
                    cash gets very stiff and hard, once opened it’s amazing how much space
                    it takes. I can cover my Queen sized modified Ikea bed really well with
                    only 1 – $10,000 package of $20’s. It is comfortable to spend and can be
                    deposited into banks. However, I have not told people where I bought
                    the cash and asked for a review of what they think of it.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Now to
                    some issues I have seen right out of the bag. The corners of some of the
                    bills were bent, and some were very deeply creased. You can tell this
                    by running your hand over the bill or inspecting it closely. All the
                    water marks and security features are present but some are worn or in
                    poor condition. Overall this is a pretty decent product.

       It
                    took me a while to realize that I can buy real cash. Everywhere else on
                    the DW is counterfeit. Its doesn’t get any better than having real
                    cash!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I hope he does not shut down to the public. I like my &gt;little&lt; $2500 and $5000 orders.

       I
                    have been saying that for forever! He is not gonna change. I would like
                    to do more volume too. The problem is this is one of the few places
                    where you get what you order. I think he believes he is providing a
                    service that others need. However, the $1300 here $5000 there orders are
                    trivial in the scope of things.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I know he could be making more money if he just worked with his larger
                    clients. Deaf ears…. its just falls on deaf ears.

       Whether
                    you just want the money, or you have a problem that cash can solve,
                    cashgod will help. We have now placed 4 orders to my house and will
                    be adding another next week for the Pro pack. With a one simple
                    package in the mail you can solve almost any problem you can think of.
                    Perfect with my high maintenance girlfriend, she takes so many $100’s
                    it’s amazing. I might sell her to the circus as the most expensive woman
                    on Earth.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       For the paranoid – This is for you. It is packaged very well, sent quickly, securely, and the
                    tracking info gives peace of mind.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       + Good product support
       <br/>
       + Good packaging
       <br/>
       + Because of the size it
                    doesn’t stand out like a kilo of cocaine or weed.
       <br/>
       + no smell.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       – Slow email responses.
       <br/>
       – Occasionally
                    unprofessional.
       <br/>
       – Not very competent at answering legal or accounting questions.

                    can tell you my experience in Europe has been mostly positive. Euro was
                    new generation bills. My packages came out of Germany. I am not sure if
                    that is true or it is a mask to hide their real place. I am currently
                    waiting on my 5th order €10.000. The product is professionally packaged
                    and has tricks to hide from inspectors.

       If
                    I was Jeff I would not answer that question. I am sure the Secret
                    Service is after these guys big time and they are good at staying
                    underneath the radar.

       Hey
                    random person you make a good point. I also have gotten screwed by a
                    couple of sellers on locabitcoins. They take a steep profit for
                    themselves and I paid for it. I started moving my coin though Jeff as
                    an alternative and it was a good choice. Though every time I get a
                    package from him I still check the money for counterfeit. So far no
                    found to date.

       I
                    prefer to get my cash here. I used to use localbitcoins to cash out my
                    bitcoin. With cashgod I can cash out and make a huge profit at the
                    same time.

       Hi,
                    everyone, apparently bitcoin is regulated in New York. And it costs $5k
                    to get a license. (Don’t believe me, google it) Does anyone have
                    experience or know any more info on how to get around this. I looked up
                    &gt;BitLicense&lt; and found that things I do not like about trading
                    bitcoin without regulation. (in NY state). I also found this warning on a
                    local bitcoin sellers page: &gt;WARNING: Due to New York’s BitLicense,
                    we will NOT do business with any person that resides, is located, has a
                    place of business, or is conducting business in New York.&lt;

       Many
                    people do not realize the actions their governments take. The USA does
                    some pretty shifty things in order to bend the reality in their favor.
                    So do other 14 Eyes Nations. I wish I could tell all the things I know,
                    but that would be certain jail time or worse for me. I will give you a
                    very basic case and point with information that is in the clear. Air
                    Force One cost about $3,000 per minute to operate in the air. Its about
                    $1800 per min while on the ground. Think about that for a moment….. A
                    flight from Washington DC to Palm Beach Florida is roughly 2 hours in
                    the air. Thats $360,000 for a one way flight! If you look at it round
                    trip plus ground cost thats over $1 million. Not to mention that some of
                    the planes we have designed costs Billions of dollars and some are
                    never produced!! Using discarded (or soon to be discarded) treasury
                    currency is nothing. When people say it ruins the economy… The amount of
                    cash that is stolen is a drop in the bucket compared to what the
                    government is spending things on. Most of those things never see the
                    light of day! Listen , I love my country and gave many years of service
                    to her, but money is going in the wrong direction and the 1% is keeping
                    it while the other 99% kill each other for what is left. That is not the
                    American Dream!

       I
                    am seriously concerned about our government. I think the USA is going
                    to experience a coup and if does the currency markets are going to go to
                    shit. Bitcoin and Gold will be the best resource.
       <br/>
       I could give 2
                    shits that I am stealing money from the gov buying preshred. I dont even
                    see it as stealing. I paid thousands of dollars in taxes and all our
                    gov does is give it to special interest groups.
       <br/>
       I am taking my money
                    back from the USA government and they can fuck themselves while I spend
                    my reclaimed cash the way I want too.

       Keep up the good work cashgod!

       I
                    fucked up big time. I did not use the cash as instructed and i tried to
                    buy a car with 15k cash. It caused all kind of problems. Dont use large
                    amounts of the cash at one time. It brings on too much heat! If you
                    dont have the discipline to handle it dont buy this stuff. Im not sure
                    they will post this but email me if you want more info.

                    was one month away from filling for bankruptcy. I am glad I did it. It
                    was a huge help and I will be out of debt within a few shipments. Thats
                    all I am going to use it for. Once they are paid I am done. I really am
                    not confortable using stolen money but I have no other choice.

       I
                    live in Germany now but ordered from you before I moved from the USA. I
                    also can confirm that the Euros are real and can be deposited at any
                    bank or used at any vendor. I highly recommend these guys. I would
                    suggest purchasing the Euro before the USD because the Euro is currently
                    in use whereas the USD is the stolen pre shred. Thats my opinion do
                    with it as you will.

                    inside $200 more than I paid for. Next time I will answer the door.

       I have heard some people getting their cash but it has a white power on it? What is the powder? Is it drugs?

       Bonjour!
                    I verify the Euro mailed to us. The package arrived from Germany. Euro
                    is hidden inside a gift which is wrapped. We will buy again.

                    Figured I would give it a go. You have a friend here in NZ mate. Quality
                    Euro and easy exchange. FYI. It took 11 days for the post to deliver
                    $25.000 US.

                    The stealth techniques used are the best I have seen from any vendor. I

      <p>
       Got
                    the cash for me and my son…mostly me. It is as described. Since I am
                    new to having money, I was looking for a 1 stop shop to get in and gain
                    rich. instructions were easy. cash packaged well. Everything worked.
                    $5,000 in $100’s is incredibly light. Deposited in the bank just fine.
                    cash checks out well, spends and gave a little boy cash to buy some food
                    I bought an RC airplane. We crashed a few time into grass – so no
                    damage done. Get some extra batteries if you buy one, which are
                    relatively inexpensive, and enjoy. Its just fun. Stack purchase from
                    cashgod +1 !!

       I
                    was one of those that got scammed by one of the clones. They had a
                    facebook page. I should have know better that true criminals would not
                    be advertising or have a portal through facebook. Lesson learned.
       <br/>
       However
                    Jeff was a true gent and added the cash I lost when I ordered the
                    Professional. There are not many guys out there who would do that for
                    their customers, even when it was the customers fault for being stupid.
                    Thanks Jeff. I will recommend you to everyone I know.
       <br/>
       BTW….for those
                    of you out there dont believe reviews on reddit or anywhere else. They
                    are bullshit and it was how I got fucked in the first place.

       K,
                    so right off the bat I will say &gt;WOW&lt;. I was not expecting this
                    to go as well as it has, kind of seems too good to be true. Upon
                    delivery I was amazed at how light the package was. Before opening the
                    package, I actually held it with one hand while I jerked off with the
                    other. I was fearing it to be empty because of it’s light weight, but
                    once opened, I was pleasantly surprised. The cash is great, it passed
                    all tests, deposited in a bank without issues. Previously I’ve had
                    issues with other TOR vendors, so this was a great relief. I just bought
                    a TV with the cash and I connected it to a very handy Winegard FL-55YR

       Mr.
                    Jeff good job on our most recent order to Hong Kong. Delivery was
                    prompt and your stealth packaging works. I will be ordering again soon.

       Hey
                    bro sending this from Bratislava. I think thats how to spell it. I took
                    both packages you sent me and I am going around europe. The strippers
                    here are hot as fuck dude and the cash helps keep my addiction going.

       Jeff
                    I saw that post too about being able to order multiple packages at one
                    time. Have you dropped the 2 weeks waiting rule? If so that would be
                    great. Im not a big fan of waiting every 2 weeks for cash either.

       I
                    think you guys are brillent. You have been trading your stolen cash for
                    bitcoin for over a year now. You must have had a good feeling that it
                    was going up in value. I started doing the same thing. I hope you dont
                    mind I stole your idea. I am using my pre shred cash to buy bitcoin and
                    save it for a rainy day. 10 years from now it could be worth a fortune.

                    large order ($25,000) can anyone on the forum tell me their experience
                    with the larger packages? I was thinking of having them shipped in 4 or 5
                    different shipments.

                    I was another one of those people who were reluctant to buy. I could
                    not bring myself to believe it was real. I am glad I did though and
                    pushed passed the fear. Our order arrived professionally packaged. It
                    reminded me of when I used to get birthday cards in the mail with money
                    in it. I remember being so excited. Thank you for bring our the kid in
                    me again.

       Yes,
                    I order from cashgod! I’m a full-time working mom of 2 sweet boys,
                    2.5 yrs and 6 mos. I purchased the Elite with my first and spent it all
                    within 1 months. I purchased the Pro with my second and have used it
                    all within 5 weeks now and still going strong. I have a LOT to say about
                    this cash, but the bottom line is cashgod is an excellent
                    upstanding company.. save yourself time, money, and frustration and
                    purchase a standard. Even if you dont ideas on how to spend it, order
                    it. You’ll figure out ways to spend the money trust me.

       Advice
                    to all men out there. Ya’ll wonder if you dick is big enough. As a
                    woman, and knowing lots of women I have this to say… Your penis size
                    does not matter. Women want a man with money. I know that sounds shallow
                    but they want to know you can provide for them. Love fades really fast
                    if you have to eat rice and beans every night. Buy from cashgod and
                    get yourself a woman. Jen

       Yes
                    we do. We have a partner in Hong Kong who can ship USD/Euro from that
                    location. China is a big place, shipping times just depend on where you
                    live

       We
                    have been using cashgod since December 2017. Prior to that time, my
                    husband had been working two jobs for several weeks. He is currently
                    uneducated and struggles getting a decent job. We immediately purcahsed
                    the basic and pro as well as the overnight shipping. We wanted both
                    currencies to do a fair comparison. Others might enjoy the GBP because
                    they live in England and it’s convenient, but we aren’t interested. It’s
                    worth noting that our local bank accepted the USD and Euro. We had to
                    fill out some currency exchange paperwork at our bank but it wasnt that
                    hard. My idiot husband was able to figure it out so any of you can also
                    i’m sure. We use the cash to pay our mortgage a lot, and my husband has
                    added things to the shopping list when he remembers, he can never
                    remember what he wants when I go. Should I mention he adds things like
                    grey goose vodka when I’m not looking? And that’s OK because we have the
                    money to buy it. We transport ourselfs in a new Ford Mustang since it
                    is easier to pay the car note each month. I was a bit worried at first
                    about Jeff’s possible ties with criminal groups, but my feelings
                    eventually fipped the opposite way! I love making the government suffer.
                    They have made us suffer for so long after all. My granddaughter was
                    happy to see her bills paid. My daughter is a breeze to impress with new
                    toys. I purchased the best meditation apps and iTunes music. I won’t
                    say it revolutionized our lives, but it has made our lives much more
                    normal.

       My

                    grand. 4 days passed and I had 50,000 quid in cash. Real bills. I found a
                    really nice flat in Paddington for £4,000 pcm and paid cash for 12
                    months upfront for a nice discount.

                    about everyone else. I love to buy shoes. I could not afford to buy
                    shoes at Walmart before finding this site. Now I have 6 pairs of some
                    really nice Jimmy Choos

       I
                    agree , nothing we can do about moments in life when there isnt enough
                    money. I too was scared to buy something &gt;large&lt;. Then I realized
                    &gt;large&lt; is a state of mind. For me $5,000 seems like a REALLY
                    LARGE amount of money. Then I realized if I was a millionaire $5,000
                    would be nothing. So I bought the $25,000 package. Yes it was a
                    sacrifice but in the end I am glad I did. Its time to start thinking
                    like a millionaire.

       Having
                    a shortage of cash is inevitable in our life and there is nothing we
                    can do about it. And I know, there are rich fuckers all over who can
                    wave money around and get the hottest pussy in town. But that’s not our
                    case. I am broke flat broke, girl friend is a 7/10 and she gets slightly
                    less good looking when she takes her clothes off and I see the saggy
                    boobs. But I still like her. My girlfriend hates grocery shopping, she
                    can never buy enough food, not enough money. Earlier i gave my
                    girlfriend flowers, but it’s so easy for a woman to see how cheap they
                    are, drop the thing down, and resent you. The price of a good woman is
                    money. At first, I considered buying a $5,000 package, but there are so
                    many benefits to having more cash on hand than $5k. In my opinion it’s
                    definitely worth to pay for the $10k pack or greater. The shipping time
                    is great, sometimes i’m unhappy with overnight shipping taking 2 days
                    showhow. but beggers cant be choosers. During the first day I felt
                    amazing. The second day it felt less and more normal.

       Friends,
                    a quick update concerning our friends at Christians in Action. They are
                    actively working with Foreign entities to bring down some of the
                    biggest and best sites on the dark web. We have seen this with Alpha Bay
                    and of course Silk Road back in the day. It is known that Cousins in
                    Christians in Action are sending thousands of fake reviews and fake
                    profiles, including Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat. Not to mention
                    the fake directories, portals, and other items of psych ops. I noticed a
                    few posts here discussing The Hidden Wiki (THW) and reviews on other
                    sites. If you have not read my prior posts do so. Especially if you are
                    new to the darknet and tor. Cousins are notorious for establishing fake
                    credentials in order to steer illegal business in the direction they
                    want. For example, if you see reviews or links to &gt;The Hidden
                    Wiki&lt; on sites like youtube, facebook, etc relating to illegal
                    products on the darknet then be cautious. Think for just a minute if
                    someone posted on youtube about the darknet it violates youtubes terms
                    of service… ie they take it down. But if it is left up on the site you
                    have to ask yourself why? Common practice in the Christians in Action
                    organization is to misdirect and collect information. That is it. Then
                    with the information they posses they pass it along to the relevent
                    agency who then makes arrests or whatever is next in their plan. If you
                    see negative reviews on clearnet sites for illegal products, especially
                    if they are on sites owned by Google, Facebook..etc, they are most
                    likely there to either scare customers from a specific site or drive
                    them to it. You will see several &gt;Hidden Wiki&lt; links that all
                    claim to be the official and original. But those who know the darknet
                    know their is only one that has been around and continues to be around.
                    The others drive you to sites that are suspect or with negative reviews
                    attempting to stop people from using certain sites. If you blindly
                    accept what you read on the clearnet or from what you find on a Google
                    search then you are setting yourself up for trouble. Be smart.

       You
                    might be right reapple. Bitcoin charts look good. I am going to wait to
                    put my order in until after it moves past 3k per coin. With the amount
                    of coin I am sitting on I can get a nice 50k package for what I would
                    have paid for a 25k just a few days earlier.

       Cool,
                    I got the $5,000 USD today and 200 Euro with it. I guess your trying to
                    advertise your EURO Quality? It is perfect quality, it is real.

                    letter agencies are natorious for creating fake sites to screw with
                    people. The site you posted ozplayz is in fact the original hidden wiki.
                    Stay away with any .org or .com sites that claim anything with hidden
                    wiki. The last thing I would want is my info ending up on some
                    government server.

       It
                    is so fucking hard to get reliable info on the darkweb. There so many
                    hidden wiki out there now. I remember when there was just one. Gone are
                    those days. If anyone is interested here is the link to the original and
                    only real one. http://zqktlwi4fecvo6ri.onion

       $50,000
                    is more money than I have ever seen in my life. My heart is racing so
                    fast I can feel it in my throat. FEDX came to the house with two boxes
                    no sig was required. I opend the first and inside was 3 board games
                    inside those boxes were silver bags that were sealed shut. Inside those
                    bags was tons of money. The other box had just as much cash inside other
                    items. Its was well hidden. Thank you so much.

                    clear these accounts or its my ass. Hopefully you can fill their orders
                    fast.Excellent work by the way.

                    front of me. i could have sworn the UPS guy knew what was inside he just
                    smirked at me when he handed me the box.

                    was 6 days overdue and I ordered $25,000. I just sent payment for my
                    next order of $50,000 and I would appreciate it if I can get it
                    overnight.

       All
                    – Recently some packages have been delayed 1-2 days for various
                    reasons. We have been reading your complaining emails whining about how
                    your cash took a little longer to receive and how you want discounts on
                    future orders. So we got together as a team and decided our official
                    response to your complaining is &gt;Go Fuck Yourself&lt; thank you and
                    have a wonderful day, Jeff

       We
                    tried that once. The problem is people would make multiple profiles and
                    keep asking for Cash promising to send BTC once it’s received. Then
                    they would get the cash, not send us any BTC and make a new profile and
                    ask for the same thing. Over and over. Fuck that

                    Your cash was the best $2250 I ever spent.

       Gold
                    is now at good prices. As a regular people here know I am not shy about
                    giving my opinion. Take your pre shred and purchase gold. Its cheap
                    right now and when the currencies start tanking its value will go nuts.

                    dont thing BTC is going anywhere. It is a bunch of hype for nothing.
                    Though it is smart to get cash to keep in your house or some place safe
                    other than a bank. Gov all over the world are corrupt and they play with
                    your life savings like its a game.

       Tough

                    negative shit. It is hard to argue with cash in my hands now.
                    Unfortunately, people are missing out because the fear they give people.

                    shipment from you every 2 weeks. He says its automatic. How does it

       So
                    many sites on the darknet are fake! I am sooooooo happy I found
                    Cashlords. Excellent service and prompt delivery. That is hard to find
                    these days! Keep up the good work.

       I
                    read reviews of this place too. I do not believe any reviews when it
                    comes to tor. I finished my first order. I am not sure I approve of the
                    service here. I ordered the semi pro and it arrived after 11 days! Next
                    problem, there was only $4820 out of the $5000 there was supposed to be.
                    My advice fix your shipping process. If you are getting too big scale
                    it down.

       Jeff,
                    I am hearing that you might stop public orders and only sell to your
                    established clients. Is this so? If so when because I dont want to miss
                    out!

                    with a small package. Im glad I did. It arrived 4 days after I ordered.
                    Its real cash too, not the fake shit other sites are pushing.

       A
                    warning to those of you who bank with chase. I went to deposit the cash
                    I received from my order. BTW I ordered the Elite 25k…. I took $12,400
                    to the bank to deposit and pay off my Chase Visa. The clerk took the
                    money and tested it… then put it in the a counting machine…. Another
                    clerk comes over and says I cant deposit the money at the counter
                    because they do not take more than 10k in cash for credit card payments.
                    Its some new policy. Am I fucked or is this a real policy where they
                    dont take cash? I dont have a chase checking or savings only the visa.

       Its
                    written in their policy. Check out their website. I would never walk
                    into a bank and hand over that amount of money. Remember the Feds track
                    all deposits over 10k in the USA. You are making yourself a target. Do
                    small deposits over a couple of weeks. I know you want to pay off your
                    credit card but be smart about it.

       First,
                    thank you for the cash. It will help us a great deal. I do have 1 favor
                    to ask…. Do not ship money inside sex toys. I opened my mail with my 3
                    yo at the kitchen table. I didnt think it was nice for her to see a 11
                    inch black dildo. I definitely didnt want her seeing me having to pull
                    5000 in cash out the bottom of it. Thats all. Otherwise the process was
                    smooth.

                    Christians in Action. Looks like AB was compromised using Psych Ops Part
                    of the psych ops used was with the reviews. It looks like they put up
                    thousands of positive reviews and even some of the vendors were CIA
                    cousins. The mission was to increase sales in the last 30-60 days of AB
                    operation to collect as much intel including vendor and customer
                    information. They were also able to track bitcoin transfers from
                    compromised vendors. Again it goes to show dont trust &gt;reviews&lt;
                    either good or bad. The cousins are good at either driving people to a
                    site or pushing them away depending on whether or not they want you
                    doing business there.

       Jeff
                    Thanks for working with me on the certificates. Its a great idea. I
                    dont know if that is something you make public or not. So I wont go into
                    detail. But the service is outstanding. Now I have a nearly unlimited
                    source to sell my cash to and keep my wealth outside the eyes of the tax
                    man.

       Its
                    about time. My money finally arrived. I was getting a bit worried since
                    others were getting theres and I didnt hear anything. Its a amazing
                    what a little bit of cash, or in my case a lot of cash, can do to change
                    your opinion of someone. Really neat.

       Order
                    Arrived!!! Came in with FedEx today. Very professionally packaged. The
                    money was in air tight mylar bags inside a old VCR. The guts of the VCR
                    was removed so that the cash would fit. I would have never know the cash
                    was inside. I have a electric money counter that has some counterfeit
                    detection built in. Every bill passed. Banks use the same equipment. I
                    am sold !!! TY

       Justin,
                    no worries. I had the same thing happen to me. My order was for 10.000
                    and I received 9.930. I sent an email on on my next order Jeff threw in
                    an extra grand.

                    I am doing my second order with you. I no issues then, but it seems
                    like you are getting backed up on orders. Hopefully I will get the
                    second order on time.

       I
                    would not give this place 5 stars. I ordered the Semi Professional
                    $5,000. I ordered overnight. It took 5 days for me to get it. Plus the
                    box had $4,940. They shorted me $60. The one positive is that the cash
                    is what they advertise it to be.

       Dear
                    Brad,I am been very very patient.You shipped me $2,460 on my
                    first order. That’s $40 less then what I was owned. Then you told me you
                    would &gt;Make it right&lt; on my second order but you sent $5050, an
                    extra $50 bill. I have no use for a $50 bill I wanted two fucking
                    $20’s.Yours faithful Client,2nd year senior in high school

                    and he said the cash smelled funny.I’m pretty sure of it’s authenticity,
                    i’m worried about it’s light &gt;oil&lt; smell.I want to be 100% before
                    ordering? Anyone run into cash that smells?Thank you

                    out that through you guys I can get the REAL THING!!!Do you do order
                    larger than $50,000? I move some high volume of currency.

       Is there a way I can spend this to pay off my bills? Most places dont take cash. How do I convert it?

       I
                    ordered the USD package and it was delivered to HK. No problems and the
                    stealth is quite good. I learned of the site from a contact in my
                    business. I know many have Chinese who will want your product.

                    issues with ordering or delivery. The cash is real. Some of it is in bad
                    shape. I could deposit the $$ in the bank or spend it. No one has ever
                    questioned me.

       JOEWe
                    know what the CIA/NSA is doing. Lots of Noobs use the darknet and they
                    dont understand how to use it. No one in their right mind would post
                    their experience on the clearnet about their purchase of stolen money.
                    That would be sure way of getting put in jail.Expanding on what JOE
                    said… If you are new to the darknet NEVER EVER use GMAIL, Outlook etc..
                    Definitely dont post on the clearnet on how you purchased stolen
                    pre-shred cash. Please understand, your gmail, outlook, etc is scanned
                    all the time. Your comments, videos etc are traced back to you by IP and
                    username as well as a digital fingerprint that you can not control. I
                    know of a couple of noobs who were arrested for doing stupid shit like
                    that. Plus Google (Gmail Youtube) remove the comments and videos. Its
                    against their policy to keep it posted.The only comments and videos that
                    are kept on the clearnet are from Law Enforcement including (NSA/CIA).
                    They serve two purposes, first, to scare people from using the darknet
                    or specific sites on the darknet. Second, to encourage criminals and
                    people who need to launder money to sites they are tracking.If you ever
                    see a darknet site on the clearnet with good reviews, videos, etc.. stay
                    away. Its being monitored. Likewise the reverse usually is LE trying to
                    keep people from buying at that site by scaring them away. They hope to
                    take away enough business that the site will just close down.I have
                    been buying from Jeff for almost a year now. There is no way he would
                    shut down unless he was out of money to sell.Food for Thought…..

       The
                    government is always been trying to bring and his operation down. They
                    have a hell of time trying to find him. This game they play trying to
                    scare people off is old news.I have said it before and I will say it
                    again. I think Jeff should shut this down so that the public doesnt
                    have access anymore. There are many of us veterans who buy large orders
                    every 2 weeks. I think he should just sell to us and keep this thing
                    private.

       Looks
                    like our friends at Christians in Action are engaging in some more
                    psyops. In addition to fake reviews they are posting videos as well.
                    These guys are trying to stop you the only way they can. They do not
                    want you distributing this money. I have also learned at locals are very
                    upset at the most recent shipment of pre-shred you acquired. They do
                    not want you selling it.

       ok
                    people this is the fucking dealio.. .faith, trust and beliefs are all
                    choices. a belief is just something you tell yourself over and over… of
                    ALL the crazy cunt shit things we all tell ourselves are truths and KNOW
                    are NOT, WHY? if we all made a choice to believe in THIS the momentum
                    and force could only benifit us all. so why not… BELIEVE IN IT.

       I
                    bought this because it gave me hope. I expected this to be fake and
                    most likely loose my money. After I paid I never heard from anyone. 4
                    days later a package from Fedex arrived. Inside was $4,980… I paid for
                    $5,000, but that is not the point. Now I am conflicted at to whether I
                    should spend this money. I am not sure how the got it. I know they say
                    how but I dont know if that is true or not. So now I dont know if I
                    should spend it or not. I feel like I have personally stole from the
                    government. IDK what to do. Can others tell me its ok so I can feel
                    better? I look at all this cash and I dont know what to do.

       If
                    you’re that scared just go out and buy visa gift cards or youtube how
                    to put cash on paypal, that way you can spend your money without
                    stressing so much. but i mean you knew what you were doing when you
                    bought that package so you shouldn’t be that scared lol

       Dude
                    stop being such a bitch. It’s cold hard cash. Jeff has so many happy
                    customers and countless reviews of how good it is. If you can’t get past
                    your morals you should have never ordered in the first place

       The
                    wealth of the world belong to those that dwell there within. The
                    governments steal much more than our money, they steal our lives. The
                    least you can do is take what is rightfully yours and pay it foward,
                    give to charity and the homeless and most important of all give to your
                    self.

                    according to the day. Everything is on time and no shipments on sundays,

       I
                    am super confused…. I ordered my package with overnight on Friday
                    around 7pm. Tracking shows it arrives today (10th) but Jeff wont email
                    me back when I ask him to double check the tracking #. I gave the wrong
                    address in my first email and then corrected it in the second email. I
                    want to be sure it was sent to the correct address. Wasn’t here
                    Saturday, and not on Sunday. So now i’m playing the waiting game to see
                    if there were any problems or if it arrives. some communication would be
                    nice. Communication was great before payment… But after he sent the
                    tracking info – nothing.

                    time. I hope I dont get screwed. They sent me the $1300 a couple of
                    weeks ago. I hope they send me cash again.

                    someone peaking about Saturday express shipping? Is there an extra cost
                    for that?Looks like a lot of happier customers around here.

                    the rest in cash. I booked a first class ticket to Las Vegas and here I
                    am. Had a great night last night. I have barely slept. I will be doing

                    took much time and energy, plus they lower the inventory.

                    the entire transaction. Once i made a payment I got my tracking number
                    in about 5 hours. I was scared, as this was my first transaction but I
                    kept faith. I got my package this morning and it was exactly what I
                    ordered. Thank you!

       Yeah I also ask myself if the Euro notes are real… In the descrption they talk only about USD notes and where
                    they come from.

                    Will it fit in a normal box or will it need to be shipped in two
                    seperate shipments?

       Update…
                    I got my money on Thursday!!! Bills are 100% legit. I didnt believe it.
                    I thought for sure I would get some fake shit. I am hooked when can I
                    order again? I think I read there was a time limit. What is the limit?

       I
                    dont know what Jeff would say, but I suggest you dont deposit more
                    than 5k in a 3 day period. I dont know how much you have but you dont
                    want to put attention on yourself. The law is 10k in any 24 hour period,
                    but I like to be conservative.

                    &gt;scam&lt; and &gt;fake&lt; in association with your site, but found
                    nothing. I feel the urge to be you costumer.

       We
                    are getting lots of questions emailed to us. We dont mind questions but
                    most of them are related to answers we already have posted on our
                    website. The best advice I can give is to read the FAQ’s first before
                    asking a question. Most likely your answer is there.We get tons of
                    emails everyday. We dont have time to answer the same questions over and
                    over again. Please post your questions on the forum. If you have a
                    question then most likely others have the same question. Posting it on
                    the forum allows everyone to get answers fast. Plus it will help us with
                    the emails to focus on getting packages out in a timely manner.Keep up
                    the Fight !!!!Jeff

       These
                    fuckers are relentless. They wont stop us. Money belongs to the people
                    it was created for. People work hard enough. The 1% does what they can
                    to stop us. It wont work. They can post all the fake shit they want. I
                    will keep giving the money to people it belongs to. I am tired of the
                    government corruption.

       These
                    are the best Euros on the darknet. High quality. I know you say they
                    are real I do not find any errors in them. Bought bitcoin with them in
                    person no problem.

       And
                    yet another douche bag who can not follow directions. People, if you
                    want overnight you have to follow instructions. Sending us fake or
                    incomplete shipment address fucks things up and slows down the process.
                    Send us the proper shipping information and you will get it overnight.
                    Its that simple.

       Yes
                    you did but you sent a fake address and the order could not be shipped.
                    Dumb ass you need a valid address in order to get the shipment. I
                    emailed you and it took you 11 hours to respond. You missed the shipment
                    deadline to get it to overnight.The instructions on the site are very
                    clear. You must have a legit address to ship to otherwise we cant ship
                    it.Go buy credit cards, I dont want your business. You cant follow
                    simple instructions and you a security risk for all of us.

                    this is the best site on the darknet. Cash is fantastic. i used to fuck
                    around with counterfiet. No more. hassel. I would just say if you have
                    kids or a bitchy wife dont open the package around them. These guys have
                    been known to ship dildos and other adult oriented ship with the cash.

       The mafia email was supposedly fake because Jeff got hackes. At least that’s what he told me. He fought off the

       I

                    assume they are otherwise you would not have sent them. But I want to
                    make sure.

       Cassie,
                    dont worry about the 96 series bills. They get pulled all the time.
                    Several of my shipments have 96 series bills. I have never had a problem
                    depositing them. In the USA all bills that were legally printed are
                    legal currency today no matter when the date. 96 series bills spent
                    everyday even now.Relax and enjoy.

       My
                    wife and I just got back from holiday in Monaco. We will never forget
                    it. The Gold package was a good choice for us. We went to the casino,
                    stayed in a beautiful hotel. All was paid with the Euro from the Gold
                    package.Merci

       Guys/Gals
                    not sure what you are. I did get my box of cash and it passed the
                    counterfeit tests I used. However, it was supposed to be overnight and
                    it took 3 days. Not sure why. I emailed about the issue and I never got a
                    response. I am considering another order but I hope the service is a
                    little bit better. The product is great.

       I
                    know you have the program where you can get regular shipments of cash
                    on a regular basis. I know someone who is getting that service. I asked
                    him how I can get that service and he said I had to talk you. What do I
                    need to do?

       Hey
                    Jeff,I placed an order and sent payment for the standard package with
                    overnight shipping. Sorry it took my a bit to post but I got the
                    overnight package and I am thrilled. I am placing another order as soon
                    as I am able.

       Bought
                    &gt;Basic&lt; on Tuesday to try this out and I paid the money, I got
                    my tracking within a couple of hours. So far, to me, this appears legit.
                    I am very happy so far. Let this be a warning to all who are skeptical
                    of this. The longer you sit on the sidelines the more money you miss out
                    on.

       I
                    have ordered here twice. In both instances I received the cash that was
                    ordered. As a prior member of the Christians In Action and with Cousins
                    still in the group it is standard procedure to plant a decoy to disrupt
                    illegal trade. Christians in Action has deployed several thousand decoy
                    sites and reviews with the intent of poisoning the revenue stream of
                    its targets.If you are on the clearnet conducting research about dark
                    web sites and activities then most likely ( over 90% confidence) the
                    information you are reading has been planted by Christians in Action
                    and/or one or more of its non affiliated Cousins. Jeff’s operation does
                    a excellent job Dry Cleaning their operation. I am sure its driving the
                    US government crazy.I post this as an admirer of this site and its
                    operator or operators &gt;Jeff&lt;. I believe the Robin Hood principle
                    is noble and, based on Christians in Action activities, he is very
                    successful at the acquisition and disposition of very large amounts of
                    US currency.I write this for the benefit of all visitors of the dark
                    web. Information warfare is alive and well on the clearnet. This
                    includes Youtube videos and forums. Just because you see a housewife on a
                    youtube video giving you her review from the kitchen does not mean its
                    really a house wife in her kitchen giving you her review. This applies
                    to &gt;children&lt; who also appear in videos or only via audio.
                    Recruitment for more Cousins who are legal age (18+) but look and sound
                    younger are of high priority due to their ability to infiltrate and or
                    poison a pool. They are highly effective when used in Psyops.Be smart.
                    If this is your first visit to the darknet know that you are now in a
                    world no longer control by any one entity. Operations such as this one
                    are difficult to stop so misinformation and other techniques are the
                    most effective. Unfortunately it is highly convincing and stops
                    individuals from benefiting and/or profiting from the Robin Hood effect.

                    what he wants. As Gandhi once said &gt;if you got the money, you can
                    steal my honey.&lt;🙂

                    just 2 days. Let me know when you get it.

       Do
                    you know what &gt;Quality Control&lt; or QC Means? I bought $10,000 in
                    $100’s from you but only received $9,900. I know you’ll say its only
                    $100 bucks. I know $100 isnt alot to you, but it’s alot to me. In my
                    mind I bought a product and did not get what I ordered.I’m not asking
                    you to make this right, i’m asking you to take quality control
                    seriously.

                    because we are providing your income, you would be nothing without us

       I
                    tried a technique to move the cash without having to put it in the
                    bank. I take the cash and buy gift cards then I buy first class and
                    business class tickets using gift certificates from the airlines. I then
                    resell the gift certificates at a discount. I works pretty well.

       There

                    different words. The information on method is the same. The pricing is
                    slightly different and the deals are also similar. I could go on an on
                    about the similarities.The link is here for you to check out yourself:
                    https://xyaukzqqcdkop4ui.onion.cabThe question thus become: who is real?
                    Are any of them real? Is there any *real* proof?What’s the deal, Jeff?

       Hey
                    thanks for bringing this up. This website is a clone/dishonest website
                    run by an Indian scam team.As more evidence that we’re the real site:1.
                    Updating forum – their forum’s last comment was in October 2017.2.
                    Images with our website address in the photo. Only we have the cash to
                    take photos of it.Jeff

       So
                    I am a first time customer and bought the 10k deal. Most of the cash I
                    got was in 20’s. I am trying to convert my cash into my local currency.
                    The guy at the exchange said he doesn’t buy 20’s only 100’s. I guess I
                    will order 100’s with my next order.Jeff have you heard of anything
                    like this before?

                    is bullshit. No one can or should steal from the FED. It is better to
                    use stolen Credit Cards. Visa &amp; Mastercard are the real criminals.

       You
                    are insane. Counterfeit and Card Cards are the quickest way to get
                    busted. Been there done that. Why counterfeit when you can use the real
                    thing? Thats like saying dont steal cash steal checks instead… Does that
                    make sense?

       Look,
                    everything has its pros and cons. I am an elite client with Jeff.
                    Which basically means I have bought a shit ton of cash. The pros of this
                    site. It delivers real cash. Jeff uses good stealth for the shipping.
                    The cons-you can only order once every 2 weeks. Some bullshit about
                    making sure there is enough cash for everyone. If it were up to me I
                    would just by it all and fuck the rest of you. But no, I have to buy
                    every two weeks like everyone else.If you are still on the fence. Dont
                    do it!! You are not ready for this lifestyle. Plus it means more cash
                    for me.

       Hey
                    All,I was *highly* skeptical. In fact I thought buycash was selling
                    high quality counterfeit and saying it was real cash. I placed my order
                    on Tuesday morning with 2-3 day shipping, tracking received Tuesday
                    night, package received today. This is not counterfeit, it’s 100%
                    genuine and I took it to the bank. I see good reviews and I am going to
                    add my voice to theirs. I will be definitely getting 50,000k next time
                    round.May you all enjoy your cash in health and prosperity,SwissC

       I
                    know what you mean. Me too. When I ordered my first package I was
                    scared as hell, but man I am glad I did it. When that package arrived
                    and I saw that cash I knew life was about to change. Go for my man. It
                    will change your life.

       Hello
                    buycash,My name is John D. Dombrink you might have heard of me I
                    have written the book &gt;Sin No More: From Abortion to Stem Cells,
                    Understanding Crime, Law, and Morality in America&lt; and I am a
                    Professor of Criminology at the University of California, Irvine.I must
                    admit studying the TOR Network is a passion of mine, I have particularly
                    enjoyed watching your organization. I have heard about you inside my
                    circles since you created your group almost a year ago. Taking into
                    account who your stealing from, The FED, I have expected you to fail
                    numerous times. I still don’t understand how you manage to steal this
                    cash from them.I firmly believe you will be crushed by the US Legal
                    System, it is the best in the world. We catch all of the criminals and
                    remove them from society. Criminals do not belong in society, they
                    belong behind bars thinking about their mistakes. I think I will see
                    your face in the news someday, however I have respect for your
                    organization.Feel free to reach out to me I sent you an email with my
                    contact information.John D. DombrinkProfessor of Criminology, Law and

       John,I
                    think our government is corrupt and we send too many people to prison
                    for too long. I think the criminal justice system is broken. I may end
                    up going to jail but you probably deserve to be there more than
                    I.Jeff

       Oh
                    please Jeff isn’t a racist. Its the same as saying all black people
                    like watermelon, friend chicken and prefer anal sex. It sounds racist
                    but it’s scientific fact. This has all been proven in laboratories using
                    double blind studies. Sometimes triple blind studies.

                    reply to test01:Only Indian’s are scammers. In fact all Indian’s must
                    work as a scammer or a customer service representative for 1 year. Being
                    a scammer in India is a very noble profession similar to being a
                    professional athlete or minister in another country. We’re just robin
                    hood style thief’s that steal from the government.Jeff

      <p>
       Stack a sum of cash moneyThe stack only goes up or down and
                    it’s your main job to make it go up.The stack is your best friend.The
                    stack doesn’t lie, doesn’t cheat and doesn’t betray. The stack doesn’t
                    judge you, doesn’t harm you and doesn’t plot against you.The stack is
                    always there for you, in good times and it bad times.It makes bad times
                    better and it makes good time amazing.The stack might make some of your
                    fake friends jealous and it’s best enjoyed with your real niggas, the
                    ones that were there for you when you didn’t have much stack.When lost,
                    just look at the stack for mentoring: will the stack go up or down
                    following your action? Once you know the answer, you know what to do.

       I
                    just came across your site. I have bitcoin that I have been saving for
                    years. I bought it when it was low. This can be a great resource for me
                    to unload bitcoin and get an even higher return.Can I buy some larger
                    than $50,000? Maybe $100,000?

       HeySo
                    I got your cash and deposited it in the bank, but I’m worrying that the
                    bank lady is going to call the FBI. She was looking at me suspiciously
                    when I deposited $5,000 cash. I joked with her I got it selling drugs
                    but she should know that was a joke right.

                    kept the purchase price under $10,000 so that it would not be reported
                    to the IRS by the dealer.They took every bill and sent me on my way with

                    am very conflicted about this. I feel bad that its stolen money, but I
                    need it. So, I guess its ok. I pay taxes that the government misspends
                    on stupid stuff anyway. Thats me rationalizing out loud making
                    everything better.

       I
                    wanted to take a min and thank Jeff. I ordered from a scam site
                    buycash-dm was part of the email address. The site look just like
                    this. Well I was screwed. I paid and got nothing.I guess I am a dumbass I
                    found buycash from the hidden wiki and bought again. I told Jeff
                    what had happened and asked if this was a scam to please not take my
                    money. I bought the 10000 Pro and it actually arrived. Jeff even
                    through in 2000 extra which more than covered what I lost at the scam
                    site.Thank you Jeff. People Need to Know.

                    think I read somewhere here that people have exchanged them for
                    dollars.

                    euros are the real deal and they spend like any other. I am in France
                    on long term assignment. Once I get back to the states I will be
                    ordering the USD for sure.

                    guys! Let me ask you this what the fuck is wrong with banging a 13 year
                    old if its consensual? They have done studies, it doesn’t damage the vag
                    at all!Now that gays can get married its time to drop the age of
                    consent down to 13!

       The
                    real KING is the fucking credit card companies. These bastards have us
                    by the balls. The government works for these banks. Now the Fed is
                    jacking up the interest rates and guess what the CC companies are doing
                    in response? I fucking paying off my CC debt with this shit.

       Why

                    you dont have to vacuum seal it. Just wondering not complaining.

                    dollars. I dont feel back either. What buycash is doing is just a

                    got my package today, but I am short too. Is this because of the cash
                    shortage you had last week? If so what is the plan to get it straight?
                    Out of $25,000 I am counting only $23,600 that’s usable.

       All
                    governments are doing the same thing, not just the USA. Thats why the
                    darknet is important. Its a game between us and them. We just need to
                    use the resources from the darknet before the agencies take them down.

                    out for #1 and it feels so good.

       The
                    US is not so innocent. Look, the fact is the odds are stacked against
                    us. Wall Street and a few elite have control of the money system and we
                    are so stupid to believe in it. Listen people get your head out of your
                    ass and stop the rat race you are in. How hard do you work everyday just
                    to get a few slips of paper that a government says is worth something.
                    Actually, now you dont even get paper. Its just numbers in a computer
                    system. In the end this will all go to shit.

       This
                    was my first transaction on the darknet. I was very nervous. I placed
                    my order for a $1300 Basic on Friday the 10th of March. I sent the
                    bitcoin to Jeff to a wallet address he provided. After 3 or so hours I
                    got a shipping confirmation and tracking number stating my package would
                    arrived 15th of March. BTW I used the free shipping option. The package
                    arrived this morning via USPS. The envelope was a generic USPS envelope
                    and was sealed. Inside the envelope was a shrink wrapped DVD and a paid
                    invoice for $11.95 for the DVD. At this point I thought I received the
                    wrong piece of mail. I opened the DVD and inside was a sealed black bag.
                    I used some scissors and cut the top of the bag open. Inside was $1300
                    in various bills. Most of the bills were in fairly good condition. 8
                    $100 bills and 50 $20 bills.I know people are probably looking at this
                    site and wondering whether or not to order. I was one of those people.
                    Overall I am please with the transaction and would do another order with
                    them.

       I
                    have used these guys a few times. They are quick to take your money but
                    it took 8 days for me to get $50,000 in cash when I paid for overnight.

       Buying
                    and shipping cash is legal in many countries. The way these guys ship
                    their cash its hidden very well. These guys rock. Just dont let the
                    money change you.

       I
                    have a question, we have paid our bills and then some with the cash. We
                    got another $10,000 on Friday and I am not sure what to do with it. I
                    know that sounds crazy. I don’t want to deposit it in the bank because
                    we have done that already and I don’t want to raise suspicion. I am
                    nervous about keeping this amount of cash in the house.Any suggestions?

                    money. Personally, I could care less how they get it.

                    I am not sure about the negative feedback, but I have ordered from
                    buycash 3 times. I was REAL skeptical at first but I am glad I did
                    it. They do a good job packaging the cash. I would have never known what
                    was inside.

                    run out thurs/fri. Glad I got my order in.I would fucking hate to have
                    my BTC ready to buy and have to wait 2-4 weeks for more inventory. Fuck

       To:
                    Ask my SelfI get my shipments sent to one of those businesses that take
                    mail for small home based businesses. I use one of the business name
                    and tell the girl at the front desk I am with the company. There is so
                    much traffic there they never catch on. When I sign I scribble gibberish
                    so no one can tell what name is written on their. Even if they did I
                    made it up.

       I
                    had not heard anything from Jeff and his team for almost a week. I
                    thought for sure I was scammed. The box arrived a few minutes ago and I
                    am so surprised. I cant believe it.This forum isnt letting me post a
                    picture but maybe i’ll email ace one? I’m sorry I doubted you guys. You
                    came through.

                    Dildo – We accidentally sent you $10,000 for your last order instead of
                    the $5,000 you paid for and ordered. Then you get mad at us for
                    shorting you $500 on your next $10,000 order? Go fuck yourself man,
                    maybe try out shoving a dildo up your own ass to see how it feels. I
                    don’t know why everyone seems so fascinated with ass holes now
                    days.Jeff

                    shipping the cash. It makes a difference.

       I
                    use my address and my name for my shipments. I have never have had a
                    problem. I have placed 3 orders with Jeff and they arrived with no
                    issues.You know how much drugs are sent through the mail system
                    everyday? I wouldn’t worry about it. Plus, if you are that worried about
                    shipping illegal goods then maybe the dark web is not a place for you.

                    blast. I didnt quite double by money but close.I am looking forward to
                    placing my next order. BTW I enjoyed my new Titanic DVD. Its even better
                    when their is a few thousand dollars inside.

       Bernie
                    E.J.First off, Technically, ACE and his crew are saving money that is
                    about to be destroyed so that it can go back into the economy, get
                    taxed, and that tax money goes to pay your social security. So
                    technically ACE and the CiK crew are doing the economy a favor by
                    keeping thisperfectly good money in ciruclation.Second of all, If the
                    ‘White Knights’ at the govornment could crack down on on ACE and crew,
                    he would be long gone and the site would be history.Third, thanks for
                    proving every sterotype we melienals have about old people. That you are
                    old, cranky, profane, and you blame my gereration for all of your
                    problems.Thanks for proving me right 🙂BTW, my generation has made more
                    progress in our lifetime then just about every generation before us 🙂

       And

                    S-T-D Infections and viruses. God invented S-T-D’s to kill off blacks,
                    gays and fucking millennials. The world would be better off if society
                    stopped advancing around 1960 if you ask me.

                    to live off it for the rest of my god damn life. Don’t you jackass
                    Millennials ruin it for me by buying stolen cash from ACE. The
                    government White Knights will throw him in jail for reformation anytime
                    now. He will come out of jail a Christian man, reformed, and contribute
                    to society by working at Mcdonalds or Burger King.

                    man i’ve been there. sometimes i have to remind myself the darknet isnt
                    like ordering off ebay or etsy. Hang in there give the cash a big lick
                    for me when you get it.

       All
                    – Thanks for all your support!Bananapower123 – Yes it is very easy to
                    exchange Euro to Swiss francsAnonymous – No cash for porn trades
                    sorry.So one of you listed your shipping address as FBI headquarters
                    (935 Pennsylvania Ave NWWashington, DC 20535). I don’t know if it was a
                    joke or for real but fuck you, we aren’t shipping it and we’re keeping
                    your BTC. This is the first package not shipped in 2018, and it was
                    fully intentional.Jeff

       I
                    put $1,000 into the offerings tray at church. Everyone saw how much I
                    put in and they got to know I such a good person.I’m gonna keep putting
                    $1,000 into the offerings tray each week until I am 100% sure everyone
                    knows how good I am. Then I’m gonna finger-bang my neighbors wife.

       QUESTIONHey
                    ace and the community , just have a question,I live in France just
                    across border of Switzerland.Do you think I can change Euro cash to
                    Swiss francs at the Currency exchange office.For example changing 500
                    Euro (max) to Swiss francs (for not getting attention).Because I’m only
                    16!!!!!Thanks

       I
                    can vouch for these guys. They are the real deal and are nasty
                    motherfuckers. I don’t think this is their main business but the cash
                    spends. I don’t give a shit how they get it. I’m a long time customer
                    and hope to be for a long time to come.

       I
                    used to work with counterfeit currency, but now with buycash I can
                    get the real stuff minus the risk.I might be in the minority, but I hope
                    people read those fake negative reviews and stay away from here. The
                    less people who know about it the more cash that’s available for me to
                    order.

       I
                    am a regular customer here and now get regular shipments every two
                    weeks. It has changed my life.The real scammers are the government. Many
                    countries used to be on the gold standard. Meaning for every dollar
                    printed the government held one dollar worth of gold in its reserve. Now
                    the government doesn’t use that standard and they just print money with
                    nothing backing it. A dollar bill is worth a dollar only because the
                    government says it is.Guys like buycash are fucking around with
                    their system. I am sure they are going after them with everything they
                    got with fake reviews and DOS attacks etc. Of course they cant find them
                    via tor so they do the next best thing and try to scare people into not
                    buying the pre shred cash.Look people the government has fucked us over
                    and big banks and greedy politicians have taken over by tweaking the
                    system in their favor. The team at buycash has evened the score and
                    let us have our money back. The money belongs to the people. Plus, you
                    could make much better use of the money than your government.Just my two
                    cents for what its worth.

                    I saw the same reviews. I still jumped in and ordered a couple days
                    ago. Got my package this afternoon. It was pretty fast. So I’m not sure
                    what the negative reviews are from. I know Jeff has said the government
                    posts negative reviews in hopes of stopping people from buying the
                    stolen cash. It makes sense to me. The government does some fucked up
                    shit.

       @
                    Revenge with MoneyYour thinking of the website called &gt;PinkMeth&lt;
                    it was a porn revenge website. Guys would post pictures of their
                    X-girlfriends they wanted revenge on to the website. What was fucked up
                    is they included the girl’s real name and real address with the naked
                    photos. A few girls committed suicide because they were listed on it.
                    The FBI took it down.

                    FED, we aren’t selling chocolate covered caramels door to door.You need
                    to decide if you want to keep living in your dads basement listening to
                    him fuck a girl younger than you are. Or &gt;roll the dice&lt; on a

                    are you asking if they are scamming the government? Yes they are
                    fucking/scamming/screwing the government badly. Call it whatever you
                    want. They aren’t your neighbor punks stealing letters from mailbox’s,

       I’ve
                    always wanted to buy a barrel of Jack Daniels. With this cash I took a
                    few days off work, drove to Lynchburg TN, tasted several barrels until I
                    found the one I liked the best. Great experience.All together it cost
                    me $13,500. So all the Whisky was emptied into 750 ML bottles. I hoped
                    to get the whisky in the barrel to take home, not so. I also got a
                    framed certificate signed by the Master Distiller, a plaque, Crystal
                    decanter, and other little things.

                    whatever reason you sent my shipment with UPS. My past shipments you
                    used USPS. Why the change?I wasn’t home and they left a note on the door
                    that I have to go pick it up at the local UPS store? Should I get it?
                    Is it safe?Please do not ship my stuff with UPS in the future. Its too
                    much hassle.

                    I have the Elite 25k package. Which I have to say nice job on the
                    stealth shipping very unique. It looks like a few thousand of the bills
                    are marked up and torn pretty bad. Will you replace these? What steps do
                    I need to take?I can send you my btc tx number if you need it.

       Hey
                    Pregunton I am a US expat living in Mexico. I have done a few orders
                    with buycash and shipping to Mexico was never an issue. I have a
                    dollar denominated account but I deposit the cash and had no issues.I
                    dont believe buycash has pesos but you should have no problems
                    exchanging the pre shred dollars for pesos at the bank.

                    Jeff I have set up a my new household budget now that I am on the
                    regular bi-weekly shipment list. Each shipment is 5,000 so my spending
                    money is as follows.Monday – Thursday $250 per dayFriday, Sat, Sun $500
                    per dayThanks to you and the team Jeff I can now put my entire paycheck
                    (minus your fee) in savings. This is more money than I have ever had.
                    Its weird to get used to.

                    Diablo666, as you know I have been a long time customer. I have posted
                    some reviews about my experience with buycash . Now I am seeing
                    several of these posts around the dark net and clear net have been
                    changed to negative reviews.I did some investigative work, as you know
                    some of my background, and found that in every case they all trace back
                    to either US Secret Service and Department of Homeland Security. So
                    basically the US government is changing and posting fake negative
                    reviews about buycash .These guys are serious about taking you down.
                    Fight the power Jeff !!

                    25,000 GBP if they are all 20’s? That is over 1,250 20 pound notes?
                    Curious as I need to know how the package would arrive.

       This
                    was my first purchase with buycash . I bought the Elite $25,000
                    package. Since it was my first transaction I used escrow.Process went
                    smoothly from the time of order and deposit with escrow company. It took
                    4 days to receive the cash. Cash was in 20s, 50s, and 100s . Packaging
                    was secure and cash well hidden.I will be ordering again.Thank you.

                    I get a tracking number for every shipment I ordered and never get

                    Jeff waive the 2 week rule. I need more cash. I spent it all already.
                    You can make an exception cant you.Plus I am seeing all kindsof negative
                    reviews on the web. I guess the Fed is pumping out fake news like
                    crazy. They cant stop you. I hope it keeps people away. More cash for
                    me.At least let me do $2500 now, PLEASE !

                    by post. No issues. I actually found one 20 UK pound note in my stack.
                    No worries. I think I frame it.

       I
                    was nervous because of all the email issues but cash arrived this
                    morning via Federal Express looks like about half in twenties and the
                    other in hundreds.

       Jeff
                    fucked me on my last shipment and shorted me $30. I will bitch when
                    necessary but I will also praise when warranted. Jeff made good with
                    the missing $30 out my $5000 and sent me $500 extra for the
                    trouble.Thanks Jeff. I guess your not a dick after all.

       SeriouslyInterested
                    I was questioning if this was real also. I did my first order in mid
                    Novemeber. buycash delivers. Cash is real, but a little beat up. It
                    is still spendable. Most of the time cash comes in DVD’s with sealed
                    bags inside. Its good stealth.Just my 2 cents. Enjoy.

       I
                    took a girl out from work last night for valentines day. I took her to a
                    very expensive restaurant, our bill for the 2 of us was $700. We went
                    out to some clubs afterwards I paid for a VIP table service and made
                    sure we was treated like first class. She asked me how I have all this
                    money.I told her I have a good investment strategy. Oh. and yes I fucked
                    her brains out last night. Not bad, since earlier at dinner she said
                    she never gives it up on the first date. Money really does turn a girl
                    on !!

       I
                    ordered the $5,000 USD package, I should have gotten the $10,000
                    package. Now I have to wait until I can order another one. Its cheaper
                    to order the bigger packages anyways

                    goes about creating a Torbox email for a little while until Sigaint
                    comes back up which is what I did. Just be patient everybody, I’m sure
                    it will come back up soon.

       With
                    this cash I’m finally able to fully treat my anal leaking and
                    Hemorrrhoid problem. I’ll tell you all a little story….&gt;This is my
                    finger,&lt; says Dr. Brandeis. I ask him, giggling, if he’s at least
                    going to take me to dinner first. And then, abruptly, I stop laughing.
                    His finger is in my ass. This happened yesterday. not fun at all.I sleep
                    with a folded-up toilet paper against my butthole. I remove the paper
                    seconds before sex.One time a girl spotted it on the floor. &gt;Ew,
                    gross,&lt; she said. &gt;What’s that?&lt; Poker face. &gt;Oh, nothing. I
                    don’t know.&lt; What I didn’t say: &gt;That’s a tissue covered in anal
                    mucus and blood. Want to sniff?&lt;

       I’ve
                    ordered alot of cash from Jeff over the past few months. I really look
                    up to the guy, he’s like the criminal father I never had. So I
                    submitted recordings of my classical piano music to him and he told me
                    to &gt;fuck that, music is for retards and blind Negros&lt; I thought
                    Jeff was a class act, but I guess he’s just the guy to ask for Cash.

       Thought
                    I would pass this along to everyone. I have been ordering from cashgod for a few months and believe it or not I was stumped as tohow to
                    spend the cash. So I had an idea and it is working very well. Youmay
                    want to try it.I started lending the money I received from cashgod .
                    I started withsome people at the Dog Track and Casino. Then spread the
                    word aroundsome local bars. I was nervous, but I had customers on the
                    first day.People need cash. We have a great source of it through
                    cashgod.I am getting a vig of 5 points per day. I even hired a guy to
                    help me&gt;collect&lt; I am up to 2,000 per week and growing in
                    addition tomy cash I get from cashgod every 2 weeks or so.Does anyone
                    else have ideas on how to use pre shred cash to make more money???

                    Woop !!! Went to casino with my CK cash. Got my chips and played some
                    major roulette. Took 10k and spent away. Felt good to use $25 and $100
                    chips. Played the high limit slots $100 for each spin. Hit a mini
                    jackpot and won $20,000. I laughed my ass off. I just won a ton of cash
                    using stolen cash.

       All,At
                    are anticipating a shortage of USD between 2/13/2018 – 2/17/2018. If
                    that shortage is significant it will effect the GBP &amp; EURO
                    availability. We are working to keep this from being a problem but
                    please make plans in case it is an issue.Jeff Admin

       My
                    Basic pack arrived. It was in a shipment from Amazon. I open the
                    package and there is a shrink wrapped DVD call PS I Love You staring
                    Hilary Swank and Gerard Butler. At first I was like, where the fuck is
                    my cash. So I peel off the plastic from the DVD,opened it up, and behold
                    a sealed mylar bag. I got some scissors opened up the bag and YESSSS
                    cash all 20’s. I used my counterfeit pen and ultraviolet light on the
                    bills. They are real. I can feel the raised print as well. VERY NICE.I
                    will be ordering again after my 2 week wait…. which kind of sucks BTW

       Power
                    in the home should come from love, kindness, and mutual respect. not
                    from violence. Thats how my mother and father did it and that’s how I
                    treat my husband and how we co-manage the home.I’m here because I need
                    the money Cash is King provides, I dont like the dark net environment
                    and the people it attracts.

                    Hate to break it to but your her bitch. You need to put her in her
                    place with a few open handed strikes. She’ll never learn if you don’t
                    put some power behind them to make it memorable. After 5-10 minutes of
                    this you say &gt;Honey I love you, and YOU made me do this to you, I
                    didn’t want to, and its your fault.&lt; Trust me son, this is the only
                    way she’ll learn to obey your command in the home.

       Look
                    this isnt a really big deal but the last package I got (5,000 EURO) was
                    short 200. Its not a really big deal but at the same time thats my
                    money and I want it. I emailed you asking for you to mail the remaining
                    200 but you said you’ll include it in your next order. Kind of upset
                    about it but I guess 4,800 is still good.

                    say &gt;Hey you deposited this cash and it all checked out, but now we
                    dont like it?&lt; has that happened to anyone?

       My
                    2nd order went much smoother than my first. I was sure the FBI was
                    going to deliver the cash to me for the first order. That did not happen
                    though thankfully.

                    There is no way to confirm if this is legit or not. This is darknet. It
                    is not a eCommerce site on the clean net.You have to take a risk.

                    and carefully checked them in case they were counterfeits. The Euro are

       These

                    package, and it has been almost 3 weeks of non-stop spending and I
                    finally am running low on cash. The emails were quite quick and assuring
                    before, during and after purchase.THIS IS AN AWESOME BUSINESS – A TOTAL
                    SAVIOR!

       Hello
                    all –I ordered the $25,000 package and the cash was mailed as if it
                    came from an electronics repair company online. Very good stealth. The
                    package could be opened without the cash being detected. They would have
                    to unscrew electronics to get to the cash. For smaller orders they ship
                    differently.

       Well
                    I ordered $10,000 with a 50/50% split of $100’s and $20’s. I got 80%
                    $20’s and 20% $100’s.It will spend just the same and I’m not going to
                    whine about it.

       I
                    got the Basic pack yesterday – 13X$100 bills or $1,300. 1 of the
                    $100’s was too worn for the ATM, but I went inside and they accepted it.

       Risking
                    $325 to figure out if you’re legit—scary shit. But I guess that’s like
                    double or nothing roulette bets in Vegas, and I’d spend at least that on
                    a hotel there, so whatever. Hope you guys are legit, because I’m hoping
                    to ride $325 into 7 figures.

      Hooker problems

      <br/>
      <p>
       Hello
                    everyone I wanted to share a lesson.I got a hooker for a few hours like
                    I always do.I used protection as always.Instead of using this
                    &gt;Pre-shred&lt; i tried to pay the hooker with counterfeit. Guess
                    what?The hooker could feel the difference between real and fake cash.
                    She hit me in the crotch twice, took my wallet and left.Jokes on her I
                    have Syphilis, But my lesson is always to pay with real cash. You can
                    ALWAYS feel fake cash.

       I

                    night of 12/12/16. I sent $5,000 over and then nervously waited. Then I
                    kept nervously waiting even after I got tracking. I checking the
                    tracking status every 15 minutes even though I had it set to notify me.
                    Then the package arrived and I was ecstatic! Now I am blowing through
                    cash like there is no tomorrow. I am giving some $20’s out to the poor

                    you feel good like weed can. Whats better $500 weed or $2,500 cash? I
                    would rather have the weed right now. life sucks. Cash is fine though.

                    spending most it on myself though, the extra goes to respite care to be

       Hey
                    I’ve been a big hater on this forum and I am sorry. I realize how much
                    of a gift this cash is. My parents always gave me alot of money growing
                    up so I just felt entitled to being treated like royalty. I am sorry.I
                    try to limit myself to spending $1,000 a day on myself. I dont include
                    my bills through.

       I
                    ordered, got the cash and posted back when this operation started back a
                    few months ago. Look for me about 1,000 posts ago &gt;Acid Burn&lt;.
                    I’ve ordered ever since then. Back in the old days you could order as
                    many packages as you wanted each week. One week I got three (3) – $5,000
                    packages. In the early days I tried to do as many orders as I could
                    because I thought they were doing a pyramid scheme. Pyramid schemes
                    quickly become non-profitable for the organization running it because
                    they soon pay out more money then they receive. I am now 100% sure this
                    is not a pyramid scheme, the numbers just dont add up. I’ve done two
                    packages of $200,000 for the past two weeks. I don’t recommend new
                    buyers start at the highest point but I do think you all should try to
                    work your way up there, financial freedom feels good. If it was a
                    pyramid scheme he would have to process at least 600 Basic orders for
                    each one of my $200k orders. The numbers just dont add up. I sincerely
                    believe they are stealing from the government.Jeff – Criminals always
                    get caught. I’ve done time myself. But I will stick with you and keep
                    buying until it happens. And I hope and pray you do not get caught. Be
                    safe my friend.Acid Burn

       Is
                    this cash perfect? no its not. Is it in bad shape? Nope. Will it go
                    through an ATM? Yes probably 1/25 bills wont make it through machines no
                    matter how you put it in. But just spend those elsewhere.I also go by

       No
                    a Red Room is not related to Japanese Anime at all. A red room is a
                    place you can see and/or participate in interactive torture or murder.
                    I’m looking for one

       Jeff
                    your a bastard and I’m going to reveal you to everyone.10/24/16 –
                    &gt;Basic – $1,300&lt; ordered with $40 OVERNIGHT shipping. Guess what?
                    I paid $40 for FEDEX overnight and they USPS 2-3 day shipped the
                    fucking package. I let Jeff know he was a shit head and made a mistake.
                    He said they would overnight the next one for free.11/14/16 – &gt;Pro –
                    $10,000&lt; ordered and I was given free overnight shipping. IT ARRIVED
                    $500 SHORT!!!!! I’m not a rich man like some of you. $500 is ALOT OF
                    MONEY for me. I let Jeff know he was a mother fucker. Clearly he was
                    trying to spitefully screw me over. He replied &gt;Hey man be cool, you
                    still made $8250 profit right?&lt; You FUCKER, I dont care about the
                    profit I care that you fucked me!12/5/16 – &gt;Pro – $100,000&lt;
                    ordered with added $40 overnight shipping. This time delivery was good
                    (12/6/16) and the quantity was good (all $100k) However I was VERY clear
                    that I wanted ALL $100’s. And fucking guess what? He sent $80,000 in
                    $100’s and $20,000 in $50’s. FUCKING $50 BILLS!!!!! I DID NOT WANT $50’S
                    I FUCKING WANTED $100’s!!!!I’M NOT A FUCKING CHARITY YOU CANT TREAT ME
                    LIKE SHIT. I AM YOUR CUSTOMER AND YOU WOULD HAVE TO GET A DAY JOB IF IT
                    WASN’T FOR YOUR CUSTOMERS BUYING YOUR STOLEN CASH.

       Hy!I
                    got my package yesterday from Fedex. I had it shipped right to my
                    house! Packaged from a well known ebay electronics vendor with that
                    vendors labeling. Opened the package to find a old school VHS player.
                    Inside the VHS player was $25,000. Excellent stealth overall. 50% $20’s,
                    50% $100’s.Very pleased I will order again!Shreder

       The
                    politicians are put there to give you the idea you have freedom of
                    choice. You don’t. You have no choice. You have owners. They own you.
                    They own everything. They own all the important land, they own and
                    control the corporations that’ve long since bought and paid for, the
                    senate, the congress, the state houses, the city halls, they got the
                    judges in their back pocket, and they own all the big media companies so
                    they control just about all of the news and the information you get to
                    hear. They got you by the balls. They spend billions of dollars every
                    year lobbying to get what they want. Well, we know what they want. They
                    want more for themselves and less for everybody else. But I’ll tell you
                    what they don’t want. They don’t want you ruining the economy by buying
                    stolen cash from &gt;Cash is King&lt;. This is real but buy at your own
                    risk of disturbing the owners of this world.

      <br/>
      eith - Federal Bureau of Investigation -- Financial Crimes
                DivisionDecember 7, 2017 at 1:45 am
      <br/>
      <p>
       My
                    opposition and my plea for users to steer clear is rooted only in the
                    fact the website’s operators are reptilian and anti-human. They come
                    many light-years away from Earth and settle on our planet to cause
                    financial chaos and to destroy the human race.After careful studying of
                    our prior investigations, I can now say with great confidence that the
                    operators behind this website &gt;Cash is King&lt; were accessory to the
                    orchestraters of the 2008 depression. They knew about it beforehand and
                    assisted in the financial ruin. These website operators are key players
                    in the reptilian agenda, and while I wish to capture them, these
                    reptilian entities continue to elude us since the beginning of mankind
                    and my efforts would be futile. They possess ability to &gt;teleport&lt;
                    and various more other-worldly mechanisms and tools to avoid
                    detection.So while the Agency is aware that if we do have a lead on
                    &gt;Cash is King,&lt; they will employ highly-advanced reptilian
                    technology and avoid detection.I want to stress to the website users,
                    the money is real. Bank tellers and ATMs will accept it as genuine cash.
                    But you are buying it from reptilians and anti-human entities who seek
                    to destroy the world. Is free money worth selling your soul to the
                    devil?Think about that for a minute.My name is Special Agent Sean and
                    this is my advice.

       I
                    am the least racist person there is but the USA should be about white
                    mans power over the colored man. Why do I say this? Because all colored
                    people are thief’s and rapists.I have no problem with women like Leshani
                    La-Sha as long as she cooks, cleans &amp; produces babies as her
                    husband commands. I would also ask that her kind sticks to minimum wage

       My
                    name is Roger McFarland I went to school at the University of
                    Pittsburgh but I ended up taking over my Dad’s business. I am pleased to
                    say I have reached a maturity level where I don’t worry about money
                    anymore. You all can reach that maturity level also through wise
                    spending, discipline and hard work. All you low life’s buying from
                    &gt;Jeff&lt; need to learn to be happy with the money you make from
                    bagging groceries or flipping burgers. Crime is never the answer. If you
                    choose crime then I will stand up to you! I am one of the few real
                    internet crime fighters. I procured a $2,500 package from these
                    felonious miscreants and they need to be brought under the sweet sword
                    of justice! I have emailed Special Agent Sean and many other special
                    agents with my crime fighting proposals. I will use my internet Kung Fu
                    to destroy this website forever!All that buy from &gt;Jeff&lt; and his
                    Operation! Hear my call! Stop buying from them and report your actions
                    to the authorities. You may spend time in jail but you deserve to go
                    there. You will learn of our great economy while in jail and be reformed
                    into a productive citizen. You all are the problem with this

       It’s
                    been 6 weeks since I started ordering from Jeff and I have yet be
                    disappointed with the process, I’ve ordered it 2 times so far and just
                    ordered the Master. I dont care if they are getting the cash from
                    aliens, chinese, indians, the FED or where ever else. This deposits into
                    an ATM and bank tellers have no problems with it. So I continue to buy.
                    Thanks Jeff!

      <p>
       Hi,I
                    am Special Agent Sean from the Federal Bureau of Investigation. You can
                    reach me at Sean.Keith@2.fbi.gov. I have come here to recommend all
                    users to cease-and-desist purchases from this website. We have very
                    strong evidence indicating that the website’s owners have nefarious
                    motivations for mankind and humanity. While I have indicated above these
                    amounts of money were marked as ‘discarded.’ They were not. These are
                    actually printed money with highly-advanced technology. While the
                    website’s operators paint the picture that this cash were merely
                    ‘intercepted’ on-route to being shredded, that is simply not true.I can
                    reveal, after reviewing our sensitive but unclassified documents that
                    these currencies are of what is commonly-known as &gt;reptilian&lt;
                    origin. We actively seek to refuse to alert the public of
                    &gt;reptilian&lt; presence on Earth as it would cause exactly what our
                    reptilian hosts desire for, total chaos. The &gt;reptilians&lt; were
                    responsible for the tsunamis or WTC attacks. I want to stress that the
                    capabilities these reptilians do possess in relation to our natural
                    environment is the ability to create earthquakes. Having lived
                    underground the majority of their life-spans, they have a greater
                    understanding of the underworld than we ourselves, this is where they
                    gain their earthquake-knowledge. They can be attributed to the recent
                    earthquakes that shook the world. You might be asking yourself, why are
                    there so many earthquakes all of a sudden? What do you think?These
                    reptilians use advanced technology to print these currencies. This is
                    why you will never get a ‘worn’ or ‘torn’ bill, despite these bills
                    being marked as being too worn for circulation. The very method behind
                    this operation is intercepting money that is &gt;too worn&lt; for
                    circulation, yet, when you order money from these nefarious entities,
                    you will never get worn money. Why is this so? They use highly-advanced
                    technology to print replica currency that can, at times, even make real
                    genuine currency look counterfeit. That is how high-quality this
                    machinery are. Now this is an aberration, you will never get their
                    perfectly-looking bills as it will arouse suspicion as to how they
                    acquired money that looks better the money approved to circulate, while
                    they advertise discarded money that cannot be circulated anymore. So
                    what they do is create something in between, but you will never get
                    money that is too worn accidentally. What they would do is throw some
                    intentionally but this is all a deception. The &gt;too worn&lt; money
                    (i.e. ripped/defaced) would be added to your pile intentionally to make
                    it appear as if their source of money is too worn.Here is a little test
                    we can all do right now. For everyone who bought currency from this
                    website, look at your currency right now. Is the face on the bill the
                    face of a human or reptile?I am not here as an FBI Agent trying to stop
                    illegal activity and put a stop to the blackmarket by issuing
                    anti-blackmarket propaganda regarding of these reptilian hosts. This is
                    not the 1960s, government-propaganda has been outlawed many years ago
                    back during the Great War efforts.We cannot arrest the operators of this
                    website as they possess reptilian origin and will continue to elude us
                    since the beginning of mankind. The websites operators are attempting to
                    purposely disrupt the world financial system to cause total chaos. I
                    want to emphasize they are not &gt;intercepting&lt; pre-shred money.I
                    want to warn the users here that these website operators are
                    reptilian-hosts. They do not need your money or profit. They do not
                    care. They have no need for money. They only seek to cause global chaos.
                    They also not care about your moral issues as they consistently remind
                    us as reptilians are devoid of morality and empathy that humans are
                    normally equipped with. I use the term &gt;normally&lt; as even
                    pure-human leaders have indicated behavior reminiscent of
                    reptilian-personality, but they were likely influenced by
                    greater-superiors of reptilian origin. They are not trying to make money
                    from this website (they can make as much money as they want), they only
                    seek to destabilize and destroy the world’s financial systems. By
                    ushering global chaos and crisis, the reptilians will realize their
                    ultimate goal, annihilation of the human race.– Special Agent Sean

                    – Yes we will use escrow. We wont use escrow’s with physical or
                    intellectual property within US or German control. We are a criminal
                    organization and not selling cookies from Grandma. We cant risk getting
                    tracked or having a transaction frozen by using the same escrow you
                    would use to buy something on ebay.police – we would rather not sell to
                    an officer of the law…Retilian Fighter 4 Life – Go take your reptilian

       A
                    mathematician, an accountant and an economist apply for the same
                    job.The interviewer calls in the mathematician and asks &gt;What do two
                    plus two equal?&lt; The mathematician replies &gt;Four.&lt; The
                    interviewer asks &gt;Four, exactly?&lt; The mathematician looks at the
                    interviewer incredulously and says &gt;Yes, four, exactly.&lt; Then the
                    interviewer calls in the accountant and asks the same question &gt;What
                    do two plus two equal?&lt; The accountant says &gt;On average, four –
                    give or take ten percent, but on average, four.&lt; Then the interviewer
                    calls in the economist and poses the same question &gt;What do two plus
                    two equal?&lt; The economist gets up, locks the door, closes the shade,
                    sits down next to the interviewer and says, &gt;What do you want it to
                    equal&lt; ?

       I

                    the Reptilians anti-human coalition. If you buy cash from them you are
                    directly supporting the destruction of humanity.

                    I didn’t see that on your website but I may have over looked
                    it.ThanksIvory Hunter

       that
                    is all all load of shit, no way is this &gt;Pre-shred&lt; cash. Their
                    cash is provided to them by the Draconians or Reptilians. In fact it is
                    highly probably that Jeff is a Draconian himself… Reptilians are are
                    tall, blood-drinking, shape-shifting reptilian aliens controlling the
                    Earth by taking on human form and gaining political power to manipulate
                    human societies. They are from the Alpha Draconis star system and the
                    majority are now hiding in underground bases. They are the ones who
                    killed JFK, Bombed pearl harbor, the world trade center, caused the
                    tsunami in japan, and created the NBA.I have studied the cash they sent
                    me with a Mel Meter EMF/Temp Gauge and it absolutely has trace amounts
                    of reptilian particulates that are present on its surface.&gt;Jeff I
                    ask of thee if thou art a Lizarda personlle?&lt; There is a law that he
                    must answer truthfully. He will either delete this post, not answer or
                    say yes. Just wait and see…

       My
                    children are already showing the signs of a second hand cocaine
                    overdose you bastards. .. Reduced Appetite, Insomnia, Anxiety, erratic
                    behaviors ext. What the hell am I supposed to do? Call the police and
                    tell them I bought stolen cash off a sketch darknet site that
                    &gt;Jeff&lt; probably used to snort crack with? Hell for all I know the
                    cocaine was done anally using the bills. Now I have a cocaine problem
                    that could also evolve into a bacterial/viral infection! He needs to
                    hire a darknet ambulance to heal my babies.

       teliavlov,
                    fuck off man! It’s pretty common knowledge that 90% of any US paper
                    currency has cocaine residue on it from dumb mothers fuckers like
                    yourself not having a brain and using the bills to snort cocaine instead
                    of something that won’t give them HepB. You really think cocaine just
                    floats through the air waiting to get your unsuspecting kids high?
                    Wouldn’t that be fucking nice?! Such fucking morons on here complaining
                    about the dumbest shit possible. Wish Jeff would cut all you assholes
                    off, that way there would be more cash for me cause you will NEVER hear
                    me complain about such an awesome service. Would laugh my ass off to see
                    Jeff cut every single person off that called him anything but sir or
                    awesome!Assholes! Guess they are just butt hurt Hillary didn’t win…

       Man,
                    you fuckers that are complaining about anything at alll should just
                    shut the fuck up or leave this world completely. You really want to
                    complain that you big ass box of cash was $20, $50, or even $100 short??
                    So fucking what!!!! You still have a shitload more than you had before
                    the packaged arrived so why are you even looking a gift horse in the
                    mouth? Assholes!Oh and your package took one day longer to ship or two
                    days longer to receive? Again, so fucking what! At least you got the
                    package and didn’t get scammed like you thought you would! If I was
                    Jeff I was stop shipping to any asshole that complained, left a bad
                    review, or just flat out was an asshole to him because you hate your
                    life and feel the need to bring everyone down with you. Better be glad
                    it’s not me shipping the stuff or half you mother fuckers would be cut
                    off completely AND I would still keep your BTC to show you how life
                    isn’t fair and you can’t expect it to be just cause you live in your own
                    head.Some people!

       So
                    2 of my $20’s has white powder on them. I’m 90% sure its cocaine.
                    Please can you not send bills with white powder on them in the future?
                    My wife is freaking out about the powder getting into the air and
                    getting our kids high on cocaine.If it does end up getting my kids high
                    on cocaine I’m going to be extremely upset. I may drug test them later
                    just to be sure.

       I
                    put my order in 3 days ago and got it today. Also great responses to my
                    emails. I ordered the $10,000 in $100’s, so that’s 100x$100 bills. They
                    are mostly in really good condition actually. Very pleased overall. I
                    tested the bills in every way possible to make sure they arent
                    counterfeit, they are 100% valid/real bills.

       package
                    On The Way I’m Nervous- To answer your question yes the bills are real
                    and yes you can spend them at stores. The bills are pre- shredded bills
                    which means they are old and unfit to be in circulation anylonger. Hope
                    that answers your questions.If you have anymore questions ask Jeff he
                    is happy to help.

                    23, 2017 at 8:52 am &gt;Hey how long does it take to ship packages if I
                    order from them?&lt; for me it’s always taken about 3-4 days. I know
                    they claim 2-3 days but I’ve never gotten it within 2 days and I live on
                    the east coast.

                    holidays are directly created and run by Satan himself. Have you noticed
                    we dont have windows on our buildings? Its because we don’t want to
                    watch you all BURN while we prepare for glory.

       Do you change up the packaging on larger pkg’s like the pro or do have one that works and that’s what you stick
                    with?

       OK
                    EVERYONE. I ordered the Pro package $100,000 and I just got it
                    today. I have to admit I was VERY nervous but I am a happy man now.
                    Seriously holding this money is better than sex. seriously.

                    It was a good surprise though. Not like coming home to your wife

                    would stop selling to you.roar – Shipping to Mexico is no problem at
                    all. In truth we have had issues with getting through customs in some
                    countries. We have re-shipped those packages at no cost. We get through
                    customs about 19/20 times. Shipping from Germany is helping us alot
                    because it avoids sending packages through customs within the European
                    Union.Jeff Admin

       I
                    am HIGHLY skeptical!!! I got the $1,300 cash package but I straight up
                    think its drug money because its in GOOD shape. I thought this was cash
                    selected for disposal? The cash works in ATM’s but I think there is
                    something very fishy going on. personally I think these guys may be the
                    Chinese trying to destroy the USD.

       yo
                    yo roar – if you order within the US or EU you have no problem because
                    they ship within those areas and the packages dont go through customs.I
                    havent heard of any one not getting their package outside the USA, but
                    they have NINJA WARRIOR stealth packages.Jeff – any packages get
                    confiscated through customs?

       Hey
                    Ya’ll this is DUKE again. Just wanted to share this wonderful quote.
                    &gt;Black people are inferior to Caucasians. Blacks constitute a totally
                    distinct group; they overshadow the country with the germ… of evil. God

       Is
                    this possible (when sending outside US) that someone at border (custom
                    officers) will check the package? If yes, then basically you’re fucked?

                    – The Euro has been exchanged, The forum doesnt allow photos to be
                    posted sorry about that. Yes this is cash you can exchange it yourself
                    just like you would any other cash. Maybe hide your face if your really
                    ugly. You don’t need to hide your face though no one has any reason to
                    suspect you of anything. Yea you can include your phone number with the
                    shipment.&gt;MotherFucker&lt; – Really man? Your going to unload on me
                    like that because of shipping? We arent going to ship to anyone in your
                    entire city anymore. And I wont even ship you a package if I think it’s
                    you. Go fuck yourself. That was your last package of $10k, go get a job

                    to send funds through bitcoin. I replied with my shipping info, now
                    awaiting the next steps. So far it’s smoother than Trumps little hands

       few
                    questions!1. EUROs are also used (sheduled to shredder as well?) or
                    they are USD changed into new EUROs?2. No one from commenting people
                    posted some photos before, can u do it please?3. If someone don’t live
                    in the US and have different cash than USD and EURO can he just easily
                    go into nearest exchange store and exchange the cash? Even bigger
                    amounts? I have to hide my face from cameras?4. Let’s say I live in a
                    village and the postman probably would call to me and ask where the fuck
                    my house is cause he can’t find it, can I just give my phone number
                    with the order address? (just bought prepaid)5. Moar pictures please!I
                    would start with a &gt;Basic&lt; but later… ^^

                    – Hello kind sir your have to consider their operation. They have a
                    steady supply of banknotes that they procured for very low cost. Have
                    you attempted to spend €1 million Euro before? how about 1+ mil every
                    week or so? It is not easy now days with everyone using plastic cards.
                    You cannot buy cars or houses with Cash any more. If they get discovered
                    then they lose this flow of Euro and go to jail. I think they would
                    rather be very safe than risk themselves and go to jail. I am sure they
                    have stashes of Euro and USD for each member of their team also.With all
                    due respect to you and kindness to members of this forum. I do not
                    assume to speak for Jeff or any member of his team.From,The Real Roger

       if

       My
                    advice is you can ship it to a Hotel. Just call the hotel and say &gt;I
                    plan to stay at your hotel on xx/xx/xx night can I have a package sent
                    to arrive there to meet me?&lt; Then pick up the package and say you’ll
                    take it out to your car and then &gt;Check In&lt;, and never come back.
                    Works like a charm. Some of my friends get it shipped to their house
                    without issues. its up to you i guess.You can use escrow if you request
                    it. I used it the first time and then just send directly from then on.
                    Jeff is a real fucking bastard sometimes but hes trustworthy

       How
                    does receiving a shipment work, do you ship to buyers residential
                    addresses? That takes away from it being &gt;anonymous&lt; and makes it
                    easy for people to get caught . Trying to gather information before I
                    give this a try it seems sketch. Those who have purchased do you do
                    escrow, how do you receive your shipment?

                    thought it would come monday. I guess i spaced it when I looked at the
                    tracking. It was a $2,500 package the bills are in &gt;Good&lt;
                    condition, spendable but not new and crisp.

       I
                    work as a Bartender, it is very normal for me to get big wads of cash
                    like what Jeff sent me. I still love it though:)2 weeks ago I had a guy
                    tell me I was a failure of a woman because I didnt want kids and its my
                    job to stay home, have kids and clean. I also had a guy tell me
                    &gt;Once your done working here, you can come over to my place and do
                    some real work&lt; LOL

                    and I want it tomorrow. Whats up? Do I need to hire some dark net hit

       Any
                    suggestions on how to buy BTC with the most stealth? Since the new
                    largest package is now $10k I feel like that would raise an eyebrow or
                    two if I came to Wells Fargo every 2 weeks with that kind of cash to
                    exchange for BTC.Thanks!

       Counterfeiting
                    is a good idea? Sure if you want to go to jail for 20-25 years and pay a
                    $250,000 fine. Being a coke dealer in a foreign neighborhood would be
                    less stressful than counterfeiting. Trust me I have experience

       We
                    removed the $1,200 for $300 BTC package. As you all know &gt;Cash Is
                    King&lt; was advertised on YouTube under a &gt;Darknet&lt; blog and our
                    traffic is skyrocketing. We have to increase our prices to reduce
                    order’s and not fall behind like we did last week. We are 100% caught up
                    by the way.We are now offering Euro through our website. The prices are
                    a little worse than the USD because it takes more work/cost to exchange
                    the USD to EURO.Jeff Admin

                    period? I’m going to start using that one:)Yea they will send you the
                    $100k. Then after a few of them you just stop worrying about money and
                    start living. You’ll understand in a few weeks.

       I’m
                    freaking out. In the past I’ve ONLY ordered the $5,000 for $750
                    package. I just placed an order for the $100,000 for $5000 package.
                    Thats just alot of bitcoin I’m really freaking out. You know how some
                    websites are legit until you do a big order? Like &gt;Bitcoinfog&lt; is
                    legit until you send more than 1btc and then they rob you. Is Cash Is
                    King like that? can anyone chime in? I’ve gotten 3 packages of $5,000
                    from these guys on 10/14, 10/26 &amp; 11/16. Will they send the
                    $100,000? I am just looking for reassurance. just really freaking out
                    here.

       Hi
                    Guys, I got a semipro on 11/11 and got the tracking number and it still
                    hasnt arrived. It says it will arrive 11/16/16 but that would make it a
                    4 day shipment and your website guarantees 2-3??? I this a joke??

       You’ll
                    never find a Silver Certificate Bill anymore. You can find rare serial
                    #’s like &gt;000001&lt; or &gt;1234…&lt; They can be few worth a little
                    more than the face value. But I think the bank tellers snag all the good
                    ones before they get to the public.

       Most
                    of the cash I got was in good shape but a few $20’s didn’t go through
                    the ATM. I emailed mr &gt;ace&lt; about it and said he sent me
                    replacements today. Its weird to have decent customer service on the
                    dark net. Most vendors are faggots. Lets see if the replacements really
                    come thoughNow I have to wait a week and a half before I can order
                    another package. Jeff any chance you’ll relax that &gt;You can only
                    order every 2 weeks&lt; policy? That sucks I could really use another
                    $2,500 before this next weekend.

       four
                    weeks since I started ordering from this website and my life is 100%
                    better!! I’ve ordered 3 packages so far all the &gt;advanced&lt;
                    packages. It makes me sad they made a new rule about 1 order every 2
                    weeks but it will improve their operation overall. They have been
                    getting sluggish

                    Jeff, are you sending out better quality bills now days? Just asking
                    out of curiosity. I got my cash and its alot better quality cash than it
                    was when you started.

                    – We worked all 11/12/2017 and finished packaging all the delayed

                    be sure to get them all out Monday.Mr. D – We never use &gt;high
                    pressure&lt; tactics to influence people to order from us. We feel we

                    surprised no one has disagreed with you yet. But now that Trump is in
                    office maybe Americans are starting to realize where our nations
                    problems really come from – Women’s rights and non-whites.Jeff – what
                    do you think about excluding them from being allowed to order? And maybe
                    no shipping packages to states or areas with alot of minorities?

       Jeff
                    I would like to make a suggestion that will better this whole
                    community. Take a look and you will notice all the negativity on your
                    forum is coming from #1: Non-White people #2: Elderly #3: Women. If you
                    disallow those groups from ordering it will improve your whole
                    operation. The biggest problem with selling to women like Samantha,
                    Laurette F, Juicelatte ext… is this: If their on the internet then they
                    are not doing their duties in the house, kitchen and with the children.
                    You are destroying families man. And selling to non-white people is the
                    same as directly funding gangs, terrorism and unplanned parenthood.
                    Thanks for the most recent package, the cash is always appreciated and
                    is going toward funding a great cause.

       Mr.
                    Chester – No disrepect but that is the stupidest shit ever. I mean…
                    that whole story. What the hell possesed you to pay 32,150 for a car
                    when you dont have any way to prove to the system you earned it.
                    Anything over 9,999 (i think) they have to report your dumd ass. Why not
                    just make the payments and build your credit. Then you would still have
                    money and not be on anyone’s radar. AND THEN!!! You decide to tell them
                    where you got it from like some piece of shit ignorant ass snitch. You
                    deserved all of that and i hope you learned your fucking lesson. Young
                    people aren’t the problem. Its the sheer ignorance of sheep like you.
                    You give retards a bad name you dumbass. Have a blessed fucking day!

      <p>
       Recently
                    the post office delivered $100k from this kind mans organization. I
                    still don’t understand the young peoples fascination with the blocks
                    coin. It aint real unless you can hold it in your hands and examine it
                    up and down. But my daughter is so intelligent she could win an award,
                    she helps me order some medicinal pills from a market on the interweb.
                    She helped me place an order with this gentleman organization and I have
                    a really big problem that may need to be discussed with the committee.I
                    received a package full of Benjamin Franklin’s from Mr. Jeff and then
                    thought to myself &gt;Go get while the gettin’s good. I’m going to buy
                    myself a new pickup for my transportation around town&lt; so I took a
                    stroll down to the local dealership, met a very nice man named Jack and
                    he showed me some new pickup trucks. After careful review and
                    examination of the vehicles I picked one I fancied. I asked Mr. Jack the
                    dealer &gt;Young Man, How much for this truck?&lt; and he said &gt;Well
                    sir that one has a sticker on its window for $26,540&lt;. I said to
                    Jack the dealer &gt;Jack you are a gentlemen and a scholar, this razzes
                    my berries, I’ll take it.&lt; I go to pay for the pickup and discovered
                    the price increased to $32,150. He explained the add is to cover taxes
                    as well as &gt;Processing Fee’s, Dealer Prep, Deliver Charge, Lot fee
                    &amp; Advertising fee.&lt; I could tell he was an honest man so I agreed
                    to the charges. Then I opened my briefcase and counted out $32,150 in
                    cash on the table. And that’s every they get real serious and asked
                    where I got the money and called the police who took it away! I even
                    explained I purchased it from a reputable website on the inter web. Well
                    now as you can all probably tell I’m as pissed as a three legged coon.
                    You young people have ruined the nation I worked hard to build! I cant
                    even buy a car without being investigated and thieved.I would like a
                    refund of my block coins. You have done me wrong, gotten me in trouble
                    and you need to fix it.

       A
                    guy meets a sex worker in a bar. She says, ‘This is your lucky night.
                    I’ve got a special game for you. I’ll do absolutely anything you want
                    for $300 as long as you can say it in three words.’ The guy replies,
                    ‘Hey, why not?’ He pulls his wallet out of his pocket and lays $300 on
                    the bar, and says slowly. ‘Paint…my….house.’

                    this sounds so amazing to me being that I’m a noob I have some
                    apprehensions abt getting started has anyone posted pics or video of
                    them receiving the cash I will probably just step out and give it a try
                    it’s to much of an opportunity to pass by

                    poor man I can barely put food in my mouth and your talking about $100k
                    as if its nothing. I make $22k a year! It would take me 5 years to make
                    $100k!You need to keep the small order sizes open so I can feed myself.
                    If I starve and die its ur fault man.

       I
                    think you need to increase your manpower and lower your prices. Sell to
                    EVERYONE not just the rich/Jewish Cliptip half-dicks.Why not have your
                    minimum order be $100 cash for $40-50 bitcoin? Then everyone could get a
                    piece of it.

       Hello
                    just wanted to chime in. I am new to the $100k week club but why are we
                    being penalized because all the small orders are bogging the system
                    down? I suggest we have the only available package be the $100k for $5k
                    option. That way you’ll weed out all the children from your
                    operation.I’m sure I’ll get some anti-jew comments for this but why
                    should I have to suffer because the poor don’t have enough money?-Stein

       Hey
                    Anonymous – Good question. We are currently debating raising the
                    minimum to $2,500 cash for $500 btc. That should reduce the order volume
                    enough to meet all our shipment commitments perfectly instead of a few
                    running a day or two behind.We are also considering making a new policy
                    that only 1 order can be placed every two weeks. If we made this a
                    policy we would raise the maximum order size to $200,000. We cant have
                    new policies hurting our most dedicated customers after all. Do any of
                    the $100k / week guys want to chime in with your thoughts on these
                    policy changes?Jeff Admin

      <p>
       I’ve
                    only ordered the $25,000 and not the $100k package for financial
                    reasons. After they arrive for whatever reason I am not able to save the
                    $5,000 for the $100,000 package. Thats the goal though. You’ll probably
                    see another $10,000 or $25,000 order here in the next day or so. Money
                    spends FAST.Getting $25,000 in the mail almost feels as good as
                    Morphine. Its a real genuine &gt;High&lt; feeling.

       I
                    ordered their $100,000 USD product November 3rd. Package received
                    11/7/16 through their 2-3 day shipping. The stealth was very good. 90%
                    of the bills were in good condition, 10% were in bad condition but still
                    usable. I deposited $500 at my bank through an ATM to test the money.
                    Deposit worked. I will order more soon.Brooklyn – I don’t know if their
                    Jewish but I am. Please keep your verbal harassment toward my people to

                    for me. Some of you guys need to stop whining so much.

       Hello,
                    I placed an order November 28th, provided shipping address and paid the
                    proper bitcoin address, 20hrs later I received a confirmation and
                    tracking information for the package. I received the shipment itself
                    11/1/16. All of that went fine but my package was supposed to have
                    $25,000 but only contained $24,500. I emailed you about it and you said
                    you would send me $1,000 extra in my next order. I want you to make it
                    right – now. You shorted me man and I need that $500. Do the right
                    thing– 2 Diet Pepsi

                    – Are you and your team Jewish? Jew’s are always in the middle of big
                    money operations like this. Bagel-Dog’s can smell it out with their big
                    noses. If so does the term &gt;Half-Dick&lt; offend you?Yes I’m one of
                    your regular customers but not with the name &gt;Brooklyn&lt; i just
                    wanted to draw a reaction from you

       Dear
                    Jeff,I placed an order and sent my bitcoins to your wallet and
                    responded to your e-mail with my shipping info. But that was about 1 day
                    ago (11/5/16) and I haven’t got a response yet. That’s not very good
                    customer service, Im not mad tho cause I know you’re all probably busy
                    filling bigger orders since mine was very small. I’m looking forward to a
                    future of purchasing from you. I will update when something happens

       We
                    tell the world if its to good to be true then it probably is . But if
                    you found your way to this part of the web then your probably on to
                    something. The machine dosnt want you to know that there is another way
                    to get shit done. Props to whomever put this shit together. Im sure
                    there is a reason for you to be doing shit this way and i dont care ive
                    got my own little fuct up world to maintain and if this helps you as it
                    will help me if its real then fuck it lets do this. i would rather loose
                    a couple hundred dollars than a couple hundred thousand dollars finding
                    out. Ive seen some crazy shit during my 40+ years on this earth. I
                    watched as apple gave computers to school children to help write code
                    fore the apple2 then updated the computers to apple2 to write code for
                    the apple2e and so on and on. This is a fuct up world where if you dont
                    look you wont find. the machine prints money like its not even real so
                    lets do our part and use as much of it as we can before it turns into a
                    form of food stamps and credit is all we have. ill be placing a order in
                    the A.M November6 2017 if all goes well yoy will have a loyal customer
                    until the machine stops and resets.

       Another
                    message for SOME posting here:Holy shit! If these guys are multiplying
                    your money by at least 4X, and it works, why are there still
                    complaints?If you’re relying on them to get your order to you per some
                    deadline to pay your bills, maybe a long-term outlook might work better.
                    I’m looking at starting at the bottom with what we can afford, then
                    working our way up the &gt;ladder&lt;.If you think missing &gt;A&lt;
                    payment because a shipment didn’t arrive &gt;on time&lt; is bad,
                    consider the situation my wife and I are in. We’re now behind on almost
                    ALL of our obligations, largely due to the increasingly fucked-up
                    government &gt;system&lt; that handles care homes like the one we used
                    to operate. We literally have nowhere to go but up at this point.Most of
                    anything we would pay for with money from Cash is King is already late,
                    anyway, but I’m starting to figure a long-term strategy might just get
                    us caught-up, bit-by-bit, until we’ve settled our obligations and clawed
                    ourselves out of the red.It seems to me like some of the complaints
                    I’ve read are from folks who might not appreciate what being &gt;royally
                    fucked&lt; REALLY means. My wife and I sure as hell do, but we’re
                    looking for something that will help us out of our fix over time, not
                    for someone to mollycoddle us.

       ACE:Your
                    &gt;FAQ&lt; response about having no sympathy for the sick/disabled
                    gave me the first real laugh I’ve had in a while; THANKS!Until recently
                    my wife &amp; I operated an adult foster home, taking care of 2 disabled
                    adults who lived with us 24/7/365. Did that since ’02. Most of our
                    clients had fucked-up their lives with alcohol &amp; drugs and preyed on
                    those weaker than them, and no other caregivers would take them. Worked
                    fine while &gt;the system&lt; made them at least take a stab at wearing
                    &gt;big boy pants&lt;. NOW &gt;the system&lt; just allows them to be
                    pussies &amp; looks-out for their &gt;happiness&lt;, so when they want
                    to move because of others being &gt;all up in their business&lt;, they
                    just get what they want. No consideration for the effect it has on
                    us/our finances.Long story short: less than 2 months after my wife was
                    nominated for an award in recognition of her excellence as a care home
                    operator over the last 13+ years, we don’t even have enough money to pay
                    attention.The more I review your site, the more I’m thinking your
                    service might be just what the doctor ordered. Good chance I’ll be in
                    touch soon.

       I
                    just joined the $25k club!! Holy smokes it feels so good to hold that
                    much cash! My next order will be for $100k!!!It was packaged very well.
                    The cash was vacuum sealed inside a non-transparent bag with a big label
                    on it reading &gt;First Edition of Fahrenheit 451&lt; and &gt;Do not
                    expose to oxygen until ready&lt;. All the cash even felt like a big
                    thick book when vacuum sealed also. The cash was in good condition, no
                    bills in really bad shape.Very pleased you just made a repeat customer!!

                    and they gave me a wallet number to send my bitcoin to. I sent it right
                    away received a shipping confirmation. I waited a few days more and got a
                    package of money in the mail! Now I have lots of money! It real!

       hey
                    yo -Realist- I agree it seems unreal that they are stealing from the
                    fed BUT I’ve gotten 3 packages so far. I’ve had no problems depositing
                    at the bank so I know its not counterfeit. I dont know where they get it
                    but this is too legit to pass up.

       Hey
                    &gt;BigDickProblems &amp; WHERE IS MY MOM???&lt; – You mother fuckers
                    are a real pain you know that? Order the $25k/$100k package and dont
                    depend on the $1200 or $2,500 package to get there in the nick of time!!
                    Plan ahead! We are overworked trying to hook everyone up with their
                    cash and its people like you that make it really difficult.If you keep
                    complaining we’re going to make the minimum package the $5,000 for $750
                    so we ship fewer packages and can do it faster. We’ll ignore your whiney
                    emails saying &gt;Its too expensive for us now&lt; and then where will
                    you be? Unable to pay your bills praying to the almighty Hillary Clinton
                    to ride in and give you free handouts.happy halloween mother

       Jeff
                    – I speak for the whole community here. You know me I’ve been a buyer
                    with you since the start. Lots of people depend on you guys for cash
                    each week. There are REAL PEOPLE behind each order. Respectfully can you
                    please try to ship all packages the same day as their order? Sometimes
                    it takes 2 days and that really hurts people sometimes. I missed paying
                    my car payment once because your overnight shipping took 2 days. How
                    does that happen man? Overnight shipping takes 1 day. It took 2 days
                    because you didnt ship it fast enough. Again – I like you and you’re a
                    true dealer but try to buckle it in a little, you’ve created a community
                    that depends on you.– BigDickProblems

       I
                    rely on their cash each week to pay the bills. I’ve been buying for
                    about 2 months now. What PISSES me off is when I cant pay my bills
                    because THEY DONT EMAIL/SHIP FAST ENOUGH.Jeff – I NEED you to take this
                    serious man. You need to lock it in and mail my package the SAME DAY as
                    my order. In the past its always taken you like 2 days to finish an
                    order. LOCK IT IN. I HAVE BILLS TO PAY.

       I’ve
                    been ordering for a while and they always come through. Their a bit
                    slow but trustworthy.Jeff tries to joke with me but i’m not a joker. He
                    can put his jokes up his ass and shut the hell up. I want CASH not
                    stupid jokes. Lets keep it professional.

       Hey
                    &gt;looking for money&lt; its legit but they sure do take a while. It
                    sometimes takes 24-48 hours for them to respond. Sometimes it takes 2
                    days to get their &gt;Overnight&lt; packages. Kind of shady if you ask
                    me. They should offer better service.

       All
                    – due to the large amount of orders we are adding the &gt;Pro&lt;
                    package – $5,000 for $100,000 in pre-shred. We are also removing the
                    &gt;Tester&lt; package. We feel this is a step in the right direction
                    because we cant keep up with the volume of packages we are having to
                    send.Thank you all for your continued support to our community!!ACEStack

       I
                    HOPED this was a scam but then I got cash in the mail. DO YOU REALIZE
                    THIS BUSINESS IS RUINING THE US ECONOMY? When cash that is marked for
                    shredding is reintroduced into the economy it devalues the US currency.
                    DO NOT BUY!!! DO NOT BUY!!! You are ruining the US Nation! They will
                    really send you money and it will slowly ruin this nation! I cant
                    believe this website exists. Only the government can save us now. I hope
                    the federal reserve catches you and STOPS YOU.YOU ARE RUINING THE
                    ECONOMY WITH YOUR PRE-SHRED CASH. STOP SENDING MONEY OUT. STOP IT STOP
                    IT STOP IT.

       If
                    the comments/review section here is by real customers, why doesn’t
                    anyone use dates so we can get comfortable knowing when the last order
                    was successfully made? C’mon people! Add the date to when you post a
                    review here so potential customers will see that you had a great order
                    processed.

                    today. I ordered the $5,000 package and he gave me $5,500 which is nice.
                    &gt;ace&lt; with cash is king makes lots of stupid jokes but i got my

       They
                    recommend an escrow which actually is reliable, after you place an
                    order they immediately send you tracking information.The escrow is
                    legit. I did a careful evaluation with several test orders and its the
                    real deal.I order the $10,000 package every single week. But I hate
                    these faggots for having such a good operation. Am sure they will delete
                    this review.

       They
                    are just assholes because they have so much money. They probably get
                    all the hot blonde girls. I’m stuck with a nasty brown haired fat girl

       This
                    guy is a cock sucker had the nerve to send email saying he had herpes
                    and it is soooo painful. STOP Telling me about your problems and send me
                    the money. 4th order in the mail today. I almost dont want to order
                    another because then I hear about his herpes.

                    Gross.I got the package of cash though.Maybe he give out his own cash
                    in exchange for being able to tell people about his genetal herpes.?

                    The lady behind the counter was shocked when I put down $5,000 on the
                    table. I’m 16 years old lol.

                    took a bunch of LSD the same day I got the cash it felt soooo good. The
                    cash became people and I learned about their tribes.

       Hey
                    its me the college man again. I’m the guy that uses the cash to buy
                    hookers. I got another $25,000 in the mail today. This package is going
                    toward my education. The next package will go toward drugs and women.
                    This is so so awesome.

       fraudulent,
                    cashgod is stealing from the US government. Do not buy stolen money
                    like this! Its not traceable but its not yours either.Honesty is the

                    very clever, especially for big package. So far everything is working as

       I’m
                    genuinely just testing to make sure these reviews are really posted by
                    people and not bots. If this goes through I’ll order the $400 package
                    and report back using the same name!

       Brad just could be a godsend to most of us who are living paycheck to
                    paycheck while the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. Finally
                    someone has come up with a real product for the average person. STOP
                    LIVING FROM PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK and supplement (or replace) your
                    income!! Could you use a little bit (or maybe a LOT) of extra cash each
                    month? And wouldnâ€™t it be great to be able to get that extra cash
                    without having to get another job?â€™ This is worth trying â€&gt; the
                    cost is negligible and the results are a hefty support of much needed
                    â€˜extra cashâ€™.

       I’ve
                    been with cashgod since the start, (I think it was june 30th) now
                    and they always deliver the goods. The Cash is always in pretty good
                    condition also, no issues spending it.

       Do they really let people post here unfiltered?I haven’t ordered anything on darknet because it is most likely
                    to get scammed.

       Just
                    another other received. Thought I would let you all know they are still
                    sending out money. I dont know if this is a scam or not but I DO get
                    legit cash in the mail.

       Originally,
                    I was skeptical of this product and its claim about being Risk Free
                    Cash. I have tried many online financial products that alluded to
                    similar claims only to be disappointed in the long-run. So, I figured
                    that I’d give this product the ultimate test: make a purchase and
                    deposit it at an ATM. I sent an email to cashgod and about 12 hours
                    later they responded. Someone will get back to you but itâ€™s not as
                    quick as I think it could be. He emailed back to my request asking where
                    I wanted it shipped, what name to put on it, payment instructions ext..
                    I sent the bitcoins and it took another day for him to confirm the
                    package had been sent. At this point Iâ€™m unhappy because I feel the
                    responses are slow. And then the package arrived and my whole world
                    changed. I canâ€™t describe how good it feels to hold a big wad of cash.
                    I took my cash and deposited it at the bank without any issues. Then I
                    paid my rent and filled my fridge with food / beer. I called in sick at
                    work and took the rest of the week off. I canâ€™t describe the freedom I
                    felt laying on my couch with a pile of money in my bank. I highly
                    recommend this product. I have never had any issues with spending this
                    money, depositing it in ATMs or banks. Since then I have purchased 4 of
                    the $20k option and am living the life I deserve.

       A
                    breath of fresh air for us would-be cyber entrepreneurs. If you’ve ever
                    had even a twinge of interest in extra cash and breaking free of the
                    rat race, I highly recommend you order this product. cashgod is very
                    generous in their offer. BRAVA, cashgod. Outta the park!

       I
                    wanted to express my apologies on this forum that I got so upset with
                    cashgod. I put in my order, sent the bitcoins and wanted an
                    immediate response. When you didn’t send a shipping notice within 24
                    hours I sent all those mean emails. Then you explained exactly all the
                    issues you were having and you promised (&amp; delivered) with sending
                    me the shipping notice that same day. The cash arrived and I was
                    extremely pleased with the good condition of the cash. You have a long
                    term customer. Thank you kindly for your patience and product you have
                    helped me and my entire family. Your awesome!

       I
                    ordered the first day the website opened. I gave it a shot because I
                    worked alot of overtime and had extra cash. Very happy to get more money
                    in the mail.
