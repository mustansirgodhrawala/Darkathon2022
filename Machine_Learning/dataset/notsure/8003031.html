    The epic tppp ban speed run
   </h2>
   <h4>
    So there's this chatroom on the dark web full of disturbing pedophiles known as the public pedo pub. I have trolled this place for months but one thing I realized is that there are so many words that make you instabanned. So I've decided to start a challenge, the tppp ban speed run. Make it happen bois.

    Ways to get banned without censored words
   </h2>
   <h3>
    Curse out all of the pedos
   </h3>
   <p>
    The mods fucking hate it when you hurt their egos, if you curse out the pedos, you will get banned.
   </p>
   <h3>
    Talk off topic
   </h3>
   <p>
    Just go completely off topic, just don't talk about pedophilia, talk about the randomest shit that's not pedophilia, the mods hate that.
