On Bucha - Russians Planned to Execute All - Source is feed from Jack Watling (twitter)
On Bucha: after my last meeting in Ukraine I was walking to the car when a senior Ukrainian
security official, flanked by two General Officers grabbed my arm and said "by the way;
the Russians have moved a unit onto the Belarusian axis who will lead the killings."
Anyone saying that Bucha is the result of brutalisation or rogue behaviour is wrong.
This was the plan. It was pre-meditated. It is consistent with Russian methods in Chechnya.
And if the Russian military had been more successful there would have been many more towns like it.
This context - in which the Ukrainians knew that there were troops preparing to perpetrate acts
like this, with the Kremlin describing Ukrainian identity as an accident of history -
also explains why Ukrainian resistence has been so fierce. They see the stakes as existential.
People calling for a specific response to Bucha are taking an atrocity out of its context.
The response should be to ensure that Ukrainians can defeat the invasion through steady and
systemic assistance. The volume and speed of kit delivered matters.


02.04 ==================================================================

Bucha. Today Ukrainian military finally took control of this city, and the press finally was able
to see what russians were doing in the occupied city for the whole month
The russians who killed every civilian also robbed all the houses, and took everything,
even washing machines, cutlery, TVs, even fridges. They ran into Belarus with all the stolen things,
and are now selling it in there to Belarusians

In the North, the enemy completed the withdrawal of units from the territories of our state
to Russia and Belarus. The main routes of the enemy columns run in the direction of the settlements
of Gomel and Mogilev regions. In addition to trucks, the columns included elements of a pontoon-bridge
fleet, rocket-propelled grenade launchers, and Iskander launchers.

Russian military opened a bazaar for the sale of l stolen blood soaked loot
â–ªï¸�In the city of Narovlya (Belarus) the occupiers set up a specialized bazaar selling property
looted in Ukraine. The "range" of looting bazaar: washing machines and dishwashers, refrigerators,
jewelry, cars, bicycles, motorcycles, dishes, carpets, works of art, children's toys, cosmetics.
That is, everything that the Russians gained through looting and looting of civilians in Ukraine.
â–ªï¸�The occupiers are also trying to exchange stolen currency - dollars and euros.
But due to internal restrictions on currency circulation, Belarusians are reluctant to agree
to exchange transactions and offer the occupiers to turn to local banks.
The Russians refuse, citing a ban on command.
â–ªï¸�Currently, the occupiers have organized a centralized supply of new lots of looting "goods"
to its market. In particular, a convoy of trucks with various property - industrial goods and
household items - is moving from the city of Buryn (Konotop district, Sumy region) towards
the state border.
â–ªï¸�In the city of Mozyr (Belarus) there are Russian military KAMAZ trucks from which soldiers
unload packages of items obtained by looting. The loot is sent to Russia by the Russian express
delivery service SDEK.

Moods in Belarusian society:
âž¡ï¸�80% are against the deployment of Russian nuclear weapons on our territory
âž¡ï¸�Two-thirds (67%) object to Russian forces bombarding Ukraine from #Belarus
âž¡ï¸�Less than 3% approve of the Belarusian army taking a full part in the war on Russia's side
