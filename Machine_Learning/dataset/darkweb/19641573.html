           We are a small group of hackers with a sophisticated botnet behind us -
                    this is how we get our accounts. We have our own working
                    zombie-network, each member of this network is a private PC somewhere
                    in the world. Our 'worm' is logging keystrokes, logins and passwords on
                    the hosts, and sending these infos directly to us.
           <br/>
           This is all you need to know.
           <br/>
           We are a familiar name within the TOR system, even
           <b>
            Softpedia
           </b>
           and
           <b>
            Webroot
           </b>
           wrote
                    articles about us. (See below.)
           <br/>
           We changed a little since then, simplified our service for the benefit
                    of everyone. And yes... we had problems in the past, so we're only
                    working with Paypal accounts for now, no more credit card stuff.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           <span>
            <b>
             <font size="2">
              How do I order?

            <br/>
            It's simple.
                    First of all, we don't need registrations anymore. (It's a waste of
                    everyone's time, this is an anonymous network anyway.)
            <br/>
            <br/>
            All you have to do is click on
            <b>
             "Board"
            </b>
            to browse our available
                    accounts. Please select the account you wanna buy, and click
            <b>
             "Buy it"!
            </b>
            The buying procedure will then begin! You'll have to
            <b>
             enter your e-mail
            </b>
            (preferably a temporary) address: this
                    will be the address where the account infos will arrive to!
                    After you enter your e-mail address, our system will calculate the
            <b>
             current bitcoin price
            </b>
            of the account (using the API for this),
                    and will give you a bitcoin address to transfer the funds to.
            <br/>
            From this point our Bitcoin-daemon starts watching this address, it
                    will watch it until the payment arrives. After 3 confirmations, the
                    BTC-daemon (our custom Lazy API) will consider the payment done, and trigger the system to
            <b>
             send your data
            </b>
            to the e-mail address you've given.
            <br/>
            To prevent double-selling, if you start buying an account, it's state will
                    change to "Locked", so nobody else can buy it. If no payment is made within
                    1 hour, the account will be unlocked again, allowing others to buy it.
                    If an account has been sold (the transaction is fully completed) it'll disappear
                    from the public list for good.
            <br/>
            If you're satisfied with the system, please tell a few words about your
                    experience after checkout, and allow us to share it with the others.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <span>
             <b>
              <font size="2">
               Are you guys legit?
              </font>

             <br/>
             <br/>
             <img align="right" hspace="5" src="./hands.jpg"/>
             Well, we guess a simple 'yes' won't satisfy you.

             In the past few months, we had some 'problems' with authorities... but
                    now we're BACK!
             <br/>
             We know our prices are a bit higher than 'usual', but there is a price if you don't want to be scammed.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             The number of scammers has risen well these days, so here are
                    a few tips to avoid them:
             <br/>
             <br/>

              <font>
               <br/>
               We don't think so, and hopefully you don't think so! Don't trust shady
                    services and 'websites' that clearly written by someone
               <br/>
               who doesn't
                    know shit about coding and programming. Sites that can be made in 5
                    minutes with Microsoft Word... gosh!
               <br/>
               <br/>

               </span>
               <br/>
               Again, no. A scammer doesn't know anything about complicated systems,
                    he/she wants one thing only: your money, and fast!

                        tips, but it's up to you what you'll do with them. It's not hard to
                        cash these out, though.)

               <br/>
               Because cashing them out all at once would raise high suspicion. We had
                    our problems with the authorities before, and don't wanna make the same
                    mistake again. If you cash out 4 or 5 accounts a month, it is OK. If
                    you cash out 100-200, that will raise serious suspicion. It's better
                    business for us to sell these to individual people, who can really cash
                    them out.

                    <br>
                    A few users are complaining over our service, marking us frauds, sometimes even scams: however, after negotiations we <b>ALWAYS</b> found out that it was the user who had made some error. To successfully complete a transaction with our system, please carefully pay attention to:<br>
                    - enter a working and <b>NOT MISSPELLED</b> e-mail address <i>(No typos: this is not Facebook or Yahoo, where you can correct your typos by writing a smiley after it: this is the deepweb.)</i><br>
                    - send the <b>EXACT</b> amount of bitcoins the system calculates for you. And definitely send them in <b>ONE TRANSACTION</b>, and not in small pieces: our BTC daemon expects the precise amount to arrive: not more and not less.<p>

                    Failure to comply with these two (simple) steps can result in a way where the system cannot mark the transaction as 'completed'.
                    In this case, you can still contact us on Torchat of course, and hopefully we can resolve it manually, but it's better for everyone to use the system correctly, so things can stay automated for everybody. So, correctly entered e-mail addresses, and the exact amount of bitcoins. These two things can save you (and us) some headaches.<p>

                    Thank you. :)-->
