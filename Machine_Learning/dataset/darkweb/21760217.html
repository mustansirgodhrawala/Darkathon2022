    Hi all. I've used both the US chipped and magnetic cards with success. The cards have been very reliable for me.
I doubt I'm the only one who they work for, good luck to everyone else.

    I've been with this group right as they started and they have't failed me once. Once you feel comfortable with them as a vendor,
their 20 pack is definitaly the best value if you want to be flooded in cards.

    Shipping took too weeks, that made me rather
upset. The card i orderd is working just like they said though. I'd give
 it 4/5 for now
and if next time is faster i'd bump it up to a 5/5.

    Ordered the minium of one card and it arrived in 3
 days with regular shipping. I was suprised because they said it could
take up to a week. I'm extremely pleased so
far and will be ordering many more cards if they continue to work out
like this order has.

    I got tired of the cloned card sellers, the cards
 have high balances but the constant hassle of having to hide your face
while using
them wasn't worth it. The prepaid cards make a world of difference.
Bravo and thankyou for offering a product such as this.

    The last card i used was a dud. I had ordered a 3
pack and the first two worked perfectly, but the last card
kept reading "invalid" everywhere i tryed to use it. I emailed you guys
about it and am just waiting for a response. Don't get me wrong, the
order was
totally worth it and if i was to only get 2/3 working cards every time
i'd still buy from you guys, but i wanted to see if i could get a free
replacement
or something. Thank you for everything so far.

    I had a problem with a magnetic card I was using yesterday at the
self check out. I've been using them there forever and always just slide
 but yesterday it declined the card
so i tried another one that I had on hand there and it got declined too.
 I think the magnetic cards won't even be allowed anymore at somepoint.
That's how it seems at least.
