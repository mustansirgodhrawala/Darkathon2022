    Escrow service
   </h1>
   <p>
    Hi! If you want to buy something on onion market and want to do it via escrow, then you are at the right place. It would cost you 1,5% of amount that you going to pay to a seller. You send us coins - price you should pay to the seller +1,5% and we send the coins to the seller just after you confirmed that you have got your order. Otherwise we send the coins back to you.
   </p>
   <h2>
    Payment in another cryptocoins than seller accept
   </h2>
   <p>
    We accept also cryptocoins which seller does not accept. In such a case you would pay 1% exchange fee.
   </p>
   <p>
    As example seller wants you to pay in Bitcoins, but you can send us Dash. We would ourselves exchange Dash to Bitcoins before sending to a seller.  And if during time that you wait till an item comes to you from the seller, exchange rates changes so that cryptocurrency you have sent to us has been cheaper and not enough to pay to seller, then you would be required to send to us additional payment.
