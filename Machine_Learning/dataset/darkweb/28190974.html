         The Federal Bureau of Investigation in the United States notified law enforcement agencies in Italy that someone had targeted a 45-year-old man from Conegliano through a murder-for-hire site on the darkweb. Local authorities discretely alerted the intended victim of the hit.
        </p>
        <p>
         By tracing the payment, investigators with the Postal and Communications Police identified the person responsible for paying for the hit. They â€œtracked the movemenent of cryptocurrencies from the virtual wallet of the suspect to the administrator of the site.â€� The investigation resulted in the identification of a 34-year-old man from the province of Treviso as the suspect.

         Police referred the information to prosecutors. According to the police, the case is an example of Italian law enforcementâ€™s â€œmodern investigative techniques.â€�
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          â€œThe whole judicial affair is characterized by some novel aspects that deserve to be highlighted. The successful identification of a user operating on the darkweb testifies that the non-indexed part of the internet, where illicit goods and services are freely offered, hitherto considered impenetrable by the Police, is no longer so. Indeed, modern investigative techniques used by the Postal and Communications Police, particularly those for tracking cryptocurrency payments, make it possible, as in this case, to trace cryptocurrency wallet holders.â€�

On April 19, 2022, mixers received â€œan all-time high of $51.8 million worth of cryptocurrency.â€� A chart provided by Chainalysis reveals that mixers received roughly $24 million worth of cryptocurrency on the same day in 2021.

        <p>
         In the report, Chainalysis laments that mixers are legal â€œdespite their utility for criminals.â€� FinCEN, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, clarified in 2020 that cryptocurrency mixers are considered money transmitters under the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and must comply with the same regulations as other money transmitters. These regulations include maintaining an anti-money laundering compliance program and following â€œKnow Your Customerâ€� (KYC) rules for Money Services Businesses (MSBs).
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          â€œGiven that increased privacy is the whole point of using a mixer, it seems unlikely that one could implement those compliance procedures and retain its user base. â€œ

         </a>
        </h2>
        <p>
         So far, in 2022, 23% of funds sent to mixers came from a cryptocurrency address associated with illicit activity. Illicit transactions accounted for just 12% of mixer activity in 2021.
        </p>
        <p>
         Chainalysis tracked several categories of illicit activity.

         Lazarus Group is a hacking group purportedly connected to the Democratic Peopleâ€™s Republic of Korea (DPRK). In 2022, Lazarus Group hackers stole roughly $1 billion in cryptocurrency from DeFi projects. Funds sent from addresses associated with the Lazarus Group and Blender.io accounted for nearly all of the remaining transactions in the same category.

        A drug dealer who sold counterfeit Adderall pills on the darkweb under the username â€œaddy4cheapâ€� was sentenced to 52 months in prison.
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         According to an announcement from the U.S. Attorneyâ€™s Office for the Eastern District of Virginia, a District Court judge sentenced Tyler Pham, 39, to 52 months in prison for conspiring to distribute between 15 and 45 kilograms of pills containing methamphetamine.

         Court documents revealed that Pham and six co-conspirators sold counterfeit Adderall pills on the darkweb from May 2019 through December 2019. Investigators linked Pham to a vendor account under the username â€œaddy4cheap.â€�
         <a href="http://darkzz65rkqz6gucd7pqr32vb6tsap7444zarmtafo5lqrjrx5gezgad.onion/arrested-darknet-vendors/" title="Addy4cheap on Darknetlive">
          Addy4cheap
         </a>
         had profiles on Empire Market and Cryptonia Market, among others. As of December 10, 2019, addy4cheap had completed 3,665 transactions on Empire and 140 transactions on Cryptonia. Based on an analysis of addy4cheapâ€™s reviews on Empire Market, investigators believe Pham received approximately $482,572.10 in sales for about 44,872 pills.
        </p>
        <p>
         Between August 2019 and December 2019, investigators conducted 20 controlled purchases from Phamâ€™s vendor accounts on Empire and Cryptonia. In total, law enforcement officers received 767 fake Adderall pills from addy4cheap. The pills weighed approximately 268 grams in total.

         The investigation into addy4cheap, according to an affidavit in support of a criminal complaint and arrest warrant, began in August 2019 after law enforcement officers intercepted a package of fake Adderall pills. Investigators interviewed the intended recipient of the package.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          â€œThe individual stated that he had on multiple occasions purchased Adderall through a [darknet market] known as the Empire Market from a vendor using the moniker addy4cheap. He did not think that the pills that hid were pharmaceutical grade as he had a prescription for Adderall and the tablets from addy4cheap were different from those that he had been prescribed. The individual stated that he received the tablets via U.S. Mail and that the retum address on the packages from addy4cheap was in Fairfax, Virginia. The individual provided agents with the tracking number from his most recent purchase from addy4cheap on the Empire Market.â€�
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         Investigators observed several negative reviews left by addy4cheapâ€™s customers on Empire Market. Some examples of the negative reviews are as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          â€œTested positive for meth with simon a/b testâ€�;
         </li>
         <li>
          â€œNot Adderall. Pressed pills. Tested positive for methâ€�;
         </li>
         <li>
          â€œDishonest vendor. Says its authentic adderall and sends meth and sugar pressed into an â€œAdderallâ€� shape. I Took this to study and ended up not sleeping for two days. It sucked. Do not buyâ€�, and
         </li>
         <li>
          â€œI tested the pills, and they contain meth. I was pretty upset since he advertised them as 100% authentic. I messaged him, and he mid the most he could offer me was a 15% dimount. Just beware buyer these are Meth pills.â€�
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         Law enforcement officers conducted undercover purchases from addy4cheap from late August 2019 through November 27, 2019. During the investigation, law enforcement officers observed Pham and his co-conspirators mailing packages that resembled the packages shipped by addy4cheap. After receiving the pills, analysts tested the pills and confirmed the presence of methamphetamine.
        </p>
        <p>
         In September 2019, law enforcement officers at the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport contacted investigators about Pham. During a search of passengers, a K-9 unit purportedly hit on a piece of Phamâ€™s luggage that contained $30,000 in cash. Law enforcement seized the money.
        </p>
        <p>
         On December 9, 2019, feds raided Phamâ€™s house and the residences of Phamâ€™s co-conspirators. The search team found roughly 200 counterfeit Adderall pills in Phamâ€™s house that resembled those sold by addy4cheap. In one co-conspiratorâ€™s residence, â€œinvestigators found over 6,000 peach tablets weighing approximately 2.2 kilograms which resemble those advertised on â€œaddy4cheapâ€� vendor pages and those received by law enforcement through controlled purchases.â€� In the same residence, officers found multiple envelopes, bags, raisin boxes, printers, and other materials consistent with the packaging materials used by addy4cheap" Approximately 400 grams of MDMA tablets, marijuana, vape cartridges, a money-counting machine, and U.S. currency were also found.
        </p>
        <p>
         After Phamâ€™s arrest in 2019, a judge signed off on a personal recognizance bond, allowing Pham to avoid pre-trial detention.

        <p>
         According to an announcement from Bulgarian customs, customs officers intercepted 120 packages of illegal substances between June 7, 2022, and June 17, 2022. Officers seized Tramadol, Oxycodone, Fentanyl, and Diazepam, among others. The packages contained approximately 120,000 pills and 40 kilograms of Khat.

         The seizures were a part of a â€œspecialized operation against drug trafficking via the darknet,â€� according to the announcement. Customs officers from a drug trafficking department of the Territorial Directorate (TD) Sofia Customs worked with the United States Drug Enforcement Administration during the operation.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          â€œDuring the operation, the customs officers carried out numerous operational and search activities, as a result of which they intercepted and prevented the dispatch of 198 shipments to various destinations abroad.â€�
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         Based on the limited information in the announcement, it appears as if law enforcement officers primarily intercepted outgoing packages. Investigators determined that the contents of the packages - small quantities of pills or other substances - were â€œnegotiated through Darknet platforms.â€� Suppliers in Bulgaria then prepared the drugs for shipment and mailed the packages to customers in the â€œUSA, Europe, and Australia.â€�

         Law enforcement officers disrupted three drug trafficking networks and dismantled one facility used by drug traffickers to prepare drugs for shipping. The Sofia City Prosecutorâ€™s Office has already initiated four pre-trial proceedings due to the interceptions. Officers have also executed search warrants at homes, offices, and warehouses in Sofia and Lovech.

        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         U.S. District Judge Sara Lioi sentenced Hasan Howard, 23, of Cleveland, Ohio, to more than six years in prison for various fraud charges. The judge also ordered Howard to pay $261,319.28 in restitution.

         According to an announcement from the U.S. Attorneyâ€™s Office for the Northern District of Ohio, Howard and his co-defendants, including Robert Nathaniel Andre Thomas, Tyvione Guthery, and Jaelen D. Lattimore, purchased stolen financial information on the darkweb, including credit card numbers and debit card numbers.
        </p>
        <p>
         Howard created fraudulent credit cards by embossing cards with the stolen information purchased on the darkweb. Then Howard and his co-conspirators would purchase expensive merchandise, including jewelry and watches. In a criminal complaint, an FBI Special Agent wrote that investigators had learned that Howard had a â€œJokerâ€™s Stashâ€� account.

In another example, Howard used a fraudulent credit card to purchase four diamond and gold bracelets from a jewelry store in Canton, Ohio, worth $26,463.

         The criminal complaint described one interaction with law enforcement and one of Howardâ€™s co-conspirators:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          â€œOn or about January 6, 2021, a fraudulent transaction was reported at Sheiban Jewelers, 16938 Pearl Road, Strongsville, Ohio, belonging to victim J.M (real name known to affiant) for a total loss of $14,500. The fraudulent transaction took place on or about December 19, 2020, in which the store received a call from GUTHERY who stated that he would come to the store on the same date to make a purchase of a Rolex Yacht-Master watch.â€�
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          â€œWhen GUTHERY arrived, he presented his driverâ€™s license to the employee and provided a credit card for a layaway amount of $7,000. GUTHERY then left the store but returned later with HOWARD; video surveillance shows both GUTHERY and HOWARD entering the store. When GUTHERY and HOWARD returned to the store, they paid the full amount and received the Rolex watch.â€�
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          â€œSurveillance video also captured a Lexus G350 driven by GUTHERY, which was registered to PARRISH. On January 1, 2021,
          <strong>
           Strongsville Police Department Patrolman John Murphy spoke to GUTHERY on a phone call
          </strong>
          ; the call was recorded. During the conversation,
          <strong>
           GUTHERY admitted that he was the one who drove to HOWARD in PARRISHâ€™s car to the jewelry store
          </strong>
          . GUTHERY
          <strong>
           identified the other male as his cousin
          </strong>
          HASAN (HOWARD). GUTHERY stated that
          <strong>
           HOWARD provided GUTHERY with the credit cards
          </strong>
          and billing address of the victim to GUTHERY. GUTHERY stated that HOWARD also provided PARRISH with stolen credit card information that PARRISH used at a BMW dealership to repair her vehicle in Willoughby Hills, Ohio.â€�
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         On May 20, 2021, police arrested Howard and Lattimore after they had purchased more than $20,000 worth of jewelry from jewelers in  Aurora, Ohio. Police found an embossing machine and three Rolex watches in Howardâ€™s possession.
        </p>
        <p>
         Howard and his co-conspirators used stolen credit card information to purchase merchandise at 30 stores, causing $261,319.28 in damages.

    <p-->
        A federal grand jury returned an indictment charging two men for selling counterfeit pills on the darkweb.
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>

          Edited on July 8, 2022, to correct a price listed in a previous version of this article.
         </em>
        </p>
        <p>
         According to an announcement from the U.S. Attorneyâ€™s Office for the Southern District of Indiana, Ethan Parker, 29, of Evansville, used a pill press to manufacture fentanyl-laced counterfeit pills. Parker sold the pressed pills to co-conspirators, including Joshua Harvey, 30, of Evansville. Harvey then resold pills to â€œmid-level distributorsâ€� in their drug trafficking organization, mainly in the Evansville, Indiana, area.
        </p>
        <p>
         Parker obtained pound quantities of fentanyl powder from â€œan unknown source of supplyâ€� in Louisville, Kentucky. Harvey also drove Parker to a supplier to â€œacquire pound quantities of fentanyl powder to facilitate the manufacture and distribution of fentanyl-laced counterfeit pills,â€� according to the press release.

         Harvey and other co-conspirators would purchase pills and communicate with Parker through encrypted messaging applications and Facebook messages. In one instance, Parker directed Harvey to a â€œchannelâ€� on an encrypted messaging application where Parket sold counterfeit pills. In the channel, Parket advertised 50 pills for $375, 100 pills for $750, and 1,000 pills for $5,000. The indictment does not identify the â€œencryptedâ€� messaging application but based on the description provided, it appears to be referencing Telegram.
        </p>
        <p>
         On March 10, 2022, Harvey sent Parker a message through Facebook about aquiring counterfeit pills. Parker directed Harvey to a â€œwebpage on the darkwebâ€� where Parker sold pills.

        A prolific fraudster who produced fraudulent credit cards using stolen card numbers from the darkweb was sentenced to 108 months in prison.
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         United States District Judge Eldon E. Fallon sentenced Maurice Durio, 42, to 108 months in prison. Durio had previously pleaded guilty to a credit card fraud charge.
        </p>
        <p>
         According to U.S. Attorney Duane A. Evans, Durio operated â€œa card manufacturing plantâ€� at an office space in an office park in Houston. Durioâ€™s co-defendant, Edward Toliver, also rented office space in the same office park for the same purpose. The duo outfitted the office spaces with equipment used to manufacture fraudulent credit cards.

         Durio and Toliver purchased stolen credit card numbers from sources on the darkweb, according to a press release from the U.S. Attorneyâ€™s Office for the Eastern District of Louisiana. Toliver also purchased cards from a source he had met in prison.
        </p>
        <p>
         With the assistance of several co-conspirators, Durio and Toliver created templates for credit cards on their computers and
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          â€œdownloaded credit card templates on laptop computers and transferred the stolen credit card numbers into the templates, which were then used to create tens of thousands of fraudulent access devices. The cards would generally be printed in batches with the same name appearing on numerous cards. The name was typically the real name of a co-conspirator. The cards were embossed with numbers, and corresponding account information was encoded on the strips on the back of the cards.â€�
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         Durio and Toliver distributed thousands of fraudulent credit cards to people who purchased valuable merchandise or gift cards.
        </p>
        <p>
         Investigators learned about the operation after arresting people who had cards produced by Durio in their possession. Law enforcement officers from the Secret Service â€œwere able to tie these card seizures to the plantsâ€� operated by Durio.
        </p>
        <p>
         During the execution of a search warrant at the office park in Houston, feds seized access to device-making equipment, embossers, scanners, high-end printers, thousands of fraudulent credit cards, and a laptop computer. Durio had saved 80,000 stolen credit card numbers in files on the computer. On other computers used by Durio, feds found approximately 300,000 additional stolen card numbers.

        The administrator of one of the â€œworldâ€™s largest child pornography websitesâ€� was sentenced to two years in prison for hiding proceeds from the forum.
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Son Jong-woo, the convicted operator of the Welcome To Video forum on the darkweb, was sentenced to five years in prison for concealing about 400 million won ($305,000). The money came from users of Sonâ€™s forum who spent Bitcoin to access child sexual abuse material (CSAM).
        </p>
        <p>
         The defendant has already served an 18-month sentence for violating child protection laws. A grand jury in the United States returned an indictment, accusing Son of:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          Conspiracy to Advertise Child Pornography;
         </li>
         <li>
          Advertising Child Pornography;
         </li>
         <li>
          Production of Child Pornography for Importation to the United States;
         </li>
         <li>
          Conspiracy to Distribute Child Pornography;
         </li>
         <li>
          Distribution of Child Pornography; and
         </li>
         <li>
          Money Laundering.
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         Before Son completed his sentence,

          his father filed a criminal complaint
         </a>
         against him for â€œviolation of the law on criminal proceeds concealment.â€� The move was interpreted as an attempt to prevent Sonâ€™s extradition to the United States.

          Seoul High Court blocked Sonâ€™s extradition
         </a>
         because Sonâ€™s cooperation would assist authorities in investigating â€œsexually exploitative content.â€� Authorities then filed new charges against Son, including criminal proceeds concealment and gambling with the concealed proceeds.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Korean National Police in South Korea arrested Son on March 5, 2018. Agents from the IRS-CI, HSI, and National Crime Agency in the United Kingdom seized the servers Son had used to host the onion service. The operation resulted in the seizure of eight terabytes of CSAM. A Department of Justice press release revealed that 45% of the 250,000 unique videos seized by police contained new images.

        <blockquote>
         <p>
          â€œWelcome To Video offered these videos for sale using the cryptocurrency bitcoin. Typically, sites of this kind give users a forum to trade in these depictions. This Darknet website is among the first of its kind to monetize child exploitation videos using bitcoin. In fact, the site itself boasted over one million downloads of child exploitation videos by users. Each user received a unique bitcoin address when the user created an account on the website. An analysis of the server revealed that the website had more than one million bitcoin addresses, signifying that the website had capacity for at least one million users.â€�

        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          â€œThe agencies have shared data from the seized server with law enforcement around the world to assist in identifying and prosecuting customers of the site. This has resulted in leads sent to 38 countries and yielded arrests of 337 subjects around the world. The operation has resulted in searches of residences and businesses of approximately 92 individuals in the United States. Notably, the operation is responsible for the rescue of at least 23 minor victims residing in the United States, Spain and the United Kingdom, who were being actively abused by the users of the site.â€�

    <p-->
        A Washington man who sold methamphetamine on the darkweb was sentenced to five years in prison.
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         U.S. Attorney Nick Brown announced that Ryan Kane, 34, of Bothell, Washington, had been sentenced to five years in prison. Kane had pleaded guilty to one count of Possession of Methamphetamine with Intent to Distribute in March 2022.
        </p>
        <p>
         The investigation that resulted in Kaneâ€™s arrest began in March 2021 after the Australian Border Force (ABF) had seized 39 computer hard drives containing crystal methamphetamine from a UPS package. The â€œseizure weightâ€� was fou kilograms.
        </p>
        <p>
         On April 25, 2021, a United States Postal Service (USPS) outbound mail parcel arrived at the SFO International Mail Facility destined for Australia. The package was declared a â€œ3.5IN DESKTOP HARDDRIVE,â€� and a Customs and Border Protention officer referred the package for inspection. Officers x-rayed the package, which revealed inconsistencies between the description and the image, according to the criminal complaint.

        <blockquote>
         <p>
          â€œIn the image, the inside of the hard drives appeared granular, as if they were full of thousands of small particles. This is in stark contrast to a smooth solid piece of metal or plastic seen from a legitimate hard drive. A physical examination of USPS Package 1 revealed 18 vacuum sealed hard drives. Furthermore, CBPO Salas opened a hard drive and observed a crystalline substance inside. CBPO Coleman tested the suspected substance inside the hard drive and it field-tested positive for methamphetamine. CBPO Salas calculated the gross weight of the hard drives with the methamphetamine to be 8,096 grams.â€�
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         On April 27, 2021, a similar USPS package arrived at the San Francisco International Mail Facility destined for Australia. The package was declared as a â€œ3.5IN DESKTOP HARDDRIVE.â€� Customs officers refereed the package for inspection. Officers x-rayed the package, noted the same inconsistencies in the first package, and then opened the package.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          â€œThe wrapping and feel of the hard drives were inconsistent with whatâ€™s expected of a new drive. Furthermore, CBPO Salas opened a hard drive and a crystalline substance was found inside. CBPO Salas conducted a field test on the substance contained inside the hard drive and determined that the substance was methamphetamine. CBPO Salas determined that the total gross weight of the meth and hard drives was 8,173 grams.â€�
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         USPS business records revealed that someone using the I.P. address 50.106.18.109 had tracked the first USPS package eight times and the second USPS package three times. The I.P. address was assigned to Ziply Fiber, an Internet Service Provider. Records from Ziply Fiber identify the subscriber for the I.P. address as Ryan Kane at 12618 NE 180th S.T., Apt EE302 Bothell, WA 98011.
        </p>
        <p>
         On June 7, 2021, agents executed a search warrant at Kaneâ€™s apartment, vehicle, and person. Agents found 1,844.1 grams of methamphetamine inside a jar in Kaneâ€™s bedroom.

         Kane told agents that he knew about the methamphetamine in his apartment and admitted that he had been selling it. However, Kane also told agents that an outlaw motorcycle gang had extorted him into selling the methamphetamine. â€œThe Defendant refused to provide any names of individuals who had threatened him or supplied the methamphetamine,â€� Special Agent Matt Eidinger wrote in the criminal complaint.

         Court documents do not disclose the username of Kaneâ€™s vendor account. They do identify Wallstreet Market as one of the marketplaces Kane had used.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          â€œSpecifically, on October 17, 2019, Mr. Kane received an order for five grams of methamphetamine from the Dark Web marketplace Wall Street. Mr. Kane processed and packaged the methamphetamine and shipped the package. The parcel contained approximately five grams of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of methamphetamine.â€�
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         The total gross weight of the methamphetamine was 8,280.4 grams.
        </p>
        <p>
         U.S. District Judge James L. Robart said at the sentencing hearing, addressing Kane, â€œThis isnâ€™t about youâ€¦. This is about what you did to the community â€¦sending drugs not just into our community, but the world. What you did is decidedly wrong.â€�
        </p>
        <p>
         â€œMr. Kaneâ€™s conviction and todayâ€™s sentence demonstrates how smugglers cannot hide behind the perceived veil of secrecy associated with Dark Web marketplaces,â€� said Special Agent in Charge (SAC) Robert Hammer, who oversees Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) operations in the Pacific Northwest. â€œHSI through its transnational law enforcement footprint will doggedly pursue these cases with our law enforcement partners within the U.S. and abroad.â€�

         United States District Judge Irene Berger sentenced Joshua Lee Parsons, 42, of Powellton, to ten years in prison, followed by five years of supervised release for buying methamphetamine on the darkweb.

        <p>
         U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP)agents at the John F. Kennedy International Mail Center seized 49 grams of heroin in a package addressed to Parsons in February 2021. On March 1, 2021, CBP agents intercepted another package of drugs addressed to Parsons. It contained 34 grams of MDMA.
        </p>
        <p>
         On March 8, 2021, law enforcement officers from Homeland Security Investigations, the United States Postal Inspection Service, the West Virginia State Police, and the West Virginia National Guard Reconnaissance and Aerial Interdiction Detachment executed a search warrant at Parsonâ€™s residence.
        </p>
        <p>
         While searching Parsonsâ€™ residence, officers seized 66 grams of methamphetamine in 103 bags, 27 grams of heroin, and quantities of MDA, ketamine, LSD, psilocin, and DMT. They also found a Hi-Point .380 ACP pistol and ammunition under the driverâ€™s seat of Parsonsâ€™ vehicle.
        </p>
        <p>
         During questioning, Parsons told officers that he had purchased the methamphetamine and other substances on the darkweb to resell them. He also told officers that he had ordered another package of methamphetamine that had not yet arrived. On March 15, 2021, officers seized the package. Inside it, they found 223 grams of methamphetamine.
        </p>
        <p>
         In June 2021, a grand jury returned an indictment accusing Parsons of possession with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of methamphetamine, possession of heroin, and being a felon in possession of a firearm.
        </p>
        <p>
         In a sentencing memorandum, Parsonsâ€™ attorney described the previous offenses:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          â€œHis offense conduct consisted of breaking into an adult novelty store four different times and first stealing $ 1,745 merchandise, then $ 59,172 in-merchandise, and then twice taking the safe; breaking into a Burger King to steal $ 7,742.23 in merchandise; breaking into a pawn shop to steal three firearms having a combined value of $ 1,049; breaking into a different adult boutique to steal $ 3,300 cash and $5,420 in merchandise; breaking into a Chinese restaurant and stealing $1,103 in property; breaking into the safe of a sports center and stealing $ 2,300 in property.â€�
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         the first time, and the entire safe the second time, and breaking into a chiropractic practice stealing property valued at $3,835."
        </p>
        <p>
         In March 2022, Parsons pleaded guilty to possession with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of methamphetamine. On June 30, 2022, Judge Irene Berger sentenced Parsons to ten years in prison, followed by five years on supervised release.

        <!--[CDATA[

    <p-->
        A man who admitted purchasing counterfeit oxycodone pills on the darkweb was sentenced to 18 months of probation for possessing firearms as a drug user.
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         In an Omaha, Nebraska, court, Chief Judge Robert F. Rossiter, Jr. sentenced 46-year-old Edward Barta to 18 months of probation for one count of possession of firearms by a drug user.
        </p>
        <p>
         In late 2020, federal law enforcement officers intercepted a package of apparent oxycodone pills en route to 46-year-old Edward Bartaâ€™s residence. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agents tested two seized pills and learned the active ingredients were fentanyl and fentanyl 4-ANPP.
        </p>
        <p>
         On December 20, 2020, DEA agents executed a search warrant at Bartaâ€™s residence in Omaha. During the search, agents found more pills and a pill grinder. They also found a Smith &amp; Wesson M&amp;P 9mm handgun, a Taurus Millennium G2, and a Mossberg 342KA rifle inside a locked safe in Bartaâ€™s house.
        </p>
        <p>
         Barta told DEA agents that he had purchased 100 oxycodone pills from a vendor on the darkweb for $800 in Bitcoin. He said he had completed ten orders of between 60 and 80 pills per order.
        </p>
        <p>
         The report said Barta told investigators he ordered 100 oxycodone 30 mg pills from a dark web vendor in exchange for $800 and that he had made approximately ten prior orders of about 60 to 80 pills per order. Barta reported to the police that he took three pills daily to manage his chronic neck pain.
        </p>
        <p>
         In one court document, Bartaâ€™s attorney provided some background on Bartaâ€™s oxycodone purchases:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          â€œMr. Barta suffers from chronic pain due a neck injury. Mr. Barta was under the care of a doctor for the pain, which ultimately led to a dependence on oxycodone. Despite being prescribed Duloxetine, it was not the proper amount for this pain. Mr. Barta sought oxycodone on the dark web for his personal use. He did not order an amount over a personal use amount, and thankfully was not killed when the oxycodone pills were later discovered to be fentanyl [â€¦].â€�
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          â€œMr. Barta finds himself before this Court on charges brought over a year after his law enforcement contact. Even though he was not arrested on December 20, 2020, Mr. Barta used the contact as a wakeup call, and immediately sought treatment. He did not wait for Christmas to be over; instead, he went to treatment and missed spending the holidays with his children. He is under the care of a treating physician who increased the Duloxetine to an amount in which gives Mr. Barta relief from pain. Mr. Barta continues to abstain from opioids.â€�
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         In February 2021, a federal grand jury returned an indictment accusing Barta of possessing a firearm as a drug user. Although Barta entered a guilty plea, his attorney wrote that Barta did not know he had violated any laws by possessing firearms.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          â€œMr. Barta did not know it was unlawful to be in possession of the firearms, and there is no evidence that Mr. Barta ever used the firearms. Mr. Barta had the firearms in locked cases and never discharged them.â€�
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         Arguing for a base level reduction of eight points, Bartaâ€™s attorney wrote that Bartaâ€™s firearms were â€œsolely possessed for collection purposes.â€� Interesting choices for collectors firearms. I will say that.

         Chief Judge Robert F. Rossiter, Jr. sentenced Barta to 18 months without special conditions.
        </p>
        <hr/>
        <p>
         Pretty decent outcome for Barta. He failed two drug tests for THC during pretrial release.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          Mr. Barta has been extremely successful on pretrial release. He had two (2) positive tests from taking Delta 8. When he failed the urine test, he stopped taking Delta 8, and had negative tests after the Delta 8 was no longer in his system. He completed treatment before these charges were even filed and is maintaining his sobriety. He has shown over a year of adhering to the courtâ€™s orders and success. He realizes his addiction is life threatening and lifelong. He takes his sobriety seriously and would request a term of probation without incarceration.
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         Is the court simply accepting the attorneyâ€™s statement as factual or can a lab actually differentiate between Delta 8 and Delta 9?

        VPN Providers with servers in India are required to maintain logs of customer names, I.P. addresses, and usage patterns.
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         As of June 27, 2022, data centers, virtual private server (VPS) providers, cloud service providers, and virtual private network (VPN) service providers must comply with new data retention regulations. Service providers are required to maintain logs for five years with the following pieces of information:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          Validated names of subscribers/customers hiring the services
         </li>
         <li>
          Period of hire, including dates
         </li>
         <li>
          I.P.s allotted to / being used by the members
         </li>
         <li>
          Email address and I.P. address, and time stamp used at the time of registration / on-boarding
         </li>
         <li>
          The purpose for hiring services
         </li>
         <li>
          Validated address and contact numbers
         </li>
         <li>
          Ownership pattern of the subscribers/customers hiring services
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         The Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In) directive includes similar requirements for virtual asset service providers, virtual asset exchange providers, and custodian wallet providers. Exchanges and custodial wallet providers are required to maintain all Know Your Customer (KYC) information and records of financial transactions for five years.

        Although Chinaâ€™s anti-drug measures have been generally successful, authorities have seen an increase in drug traffickersâ€™ use of the internet and cryptocurrencies.

        <p>
         In 2021, Chinaâ€™s anti-drug departments â€œearnestly implementedâ€� General Secretary Xi Jinpingâ€™s instructions on reducing illicit drug use. The measures have resulted in success by most standards. Although drug crimes and drug abuse have generally decreased, the Chinese government has noted an increase in drug money laundering via cryptocurrencies. In addition, people are increasingly turning to the internet to buy and sell drugs.

         A jury convicted Digweed of conspiring to supply Class A drugs, including heroin, cocaine, ecstasy powder, and 2CB, and Class B drugs cannabis, ketamine, and amphetamine. The jury also convicted him of money laundering. During the trial, prosecutors showed the jury evidence of Digweedâ€™s involvement in the supply of 12.5kg of heroin, 30-35kg of cocaine, 80kg of cannabis, 4kg of ketamine, and 3kg of amphetamine.

         After law enforcement agencies had hacked EncroChat, investigators examined messages sent and received by a drug dealer under the username â€œDiorpaw.â€� Investigators said Digweed identified himself in his messages to other EncroChat users.

         In one example provided by police, one of Digweedâ€™s contacts sent him a picture of a block of marijuana labeled â€œJohnny Weed.â€� Digweed responded, â€œHaHaHaHa lad whoâ€™s done that, its only missing dig out the nameâ€� My names Johnny Digweed init.â€� Digweed then sent the image to other EncroChat users. â€œHis messages on the dark web revealed that he supplied drugs across the northwest and managed the supply of crack cocaine and heroin to Devon and Cornwall,â€� police said. Digweed referenced Cornwall, Bristol, Middlesbrough, London, Weston-Super-Mare, and Wales in other messages.

        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          â€œDigweedâ€™s covert messages via EncroChat revealed his clear involvement as a leading figure in drug conspiracies that could have caused immense suffering to families and residents in our community. In one message sent to other handles he brazenly identified himself in messages. The messages he sent also revealed that he operated a sophisticated and organised criminal enterprise.â€�

        The blockchain analysis firm Elliptic identified Dogecoin as a cryptocurrency increasingly linked to criminal activity, including darknet market usage.
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Elliptic, which offers blockchain intelligence solutions similar to Chainalysis, published a report identifying an increase in the use of Dogecoin for illicit activity on the internet. The report demonstrates that Dogecoin is rarely used for illegal purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
         According to the company, the meme coinâ€™s criminal uses include fraud, scams, ponzi schemes, terrorism financing, malware, transactions on darkweb markets, and the child sexual abuse material (CSAM) industry. Elliptic also identified so-called â€œfar-right extremismâ€� as one form of the â€œillicit use of Doge.â€�

         The report seems accurate in that Dogecoin use has increased since its launch. I am skeptical that illicit Doge use is worth consideration. When I had a Twitter account, I saw countless scams involving Elon Musk imposters and various cryptocurrencies, including Doge. The total earnings of cryptocurrency scammers on Twitter dwarf the examples of illicit cryptocurrency use provided by Elliptic. For instance, during one weekend in February 2021,

          scammers earned more than $145,000
         </a>
         in cryptocurrency through fake giveaways on Twitter, including $26,004.94 worth of Doge.

        A man who purchased a diamond necklace with a credit card from the darkweb is facing 15 years in prison.
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         An affidavit filed by a special agent with Homeland Security Investigations accuses Demonn Chadwick Jenkins II, 27, of fraudulent use of credit card information.
        </p>
        <p>
         On June 16, 2022, Jenkins used a Capital One Platinum Mastercard in someone elseâ€™s name to purchase a diamond necklace for $9990 and a Rolex watch for $10,800 at a jewelry store on Main Street in St. Thomas.

        <p>
         The next day, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Officers at the Cyril E. King Airport searched Jenkinsâ€™ bag and discovered the necklace and watch. According to the affidavit, Jenkins â€œfailed to declare the purchases of the jewelry on his Customs and Border Protection Declaration form.â€� Jenkins had planned to return to Atlanta, Georgia, on June 17, 2022.
        </p>
        <p>
         â€œHe was later identified as the purchaser of the jewelry using footage taken from the jewelry storeâ€™s security cameras,â€� according to a press release from the United States Attorneyâ€™s Office for the District of Virgin Islands. Based on that information, Jenkins likely told CBP officers that he had not purchased the jewelry in St. Thomas. If he had the jewelry before arriving on the island and did not alter it while on the island, he would not need to pay the Customs Duties for those purchases.

          â€œThe safeguarding of our communities will always be our priority. Whilst the seizure of the firearms during this investigation is very disturbing I want to reassure people that guns like this are, thankfully, very unusual here in south Wales. Such was the weight of evidence against the majority of these defendants that he had no option but to enter guilty pleas. This is down to the hard work and dedication of my investigation team. The success of this investigation demonstrates that we will relentlessly pursue those involved in large scale criminality to ensure effective justice is sought against such individuals and they are brought to justice.â€�

        Bavarian police searched more apartments in the Passau district as a part of an ongoing investigation into darkweb drug traffickers in the area.
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         On April 17, 2022, Bavarian police searched apartments in Aldersbach and questioned another suspect as a part of a â€œmajor police operation.â€� The actions are related to the arrests of two suspected darkweb vendors in the Deggendorf district in April 2022.

         According to the Bavarian State Criminal Police Office, police arrested a 31-year-old man and a 25-year-old man during the searches in April. The 31-year-old allegedly sold marijuana through the darkweb. The 25-year-old allegedly purchased at least ten kilograms of marijuana from a darkweb vendor to resell to a â€œpreviously unknownâ€� customer.

        <p>
         During the searches of the apartments in Deggendorf, police found 400 opioid pills, marijuana, assorted narcotics, anabolic steroids, thousands of euros, and several mobile phones and tablets.
        </p>
        <p>
         Since then, police identified another suspect, a 22-year-old living in Aldersbach.

          â€œOn July 12, 2007, a series of air-to-ground attacks were conducted by a team of two U.S. AH-64 Apache helicopters in Al-Amin al-Thaniyah, New Baghdad, during the Iraqi insurgency which followed the Iraq War. On April 5, 2010, the attacks received worldwide coverage and controversy following the release of 39 minutes of gunsight footage by the Internet whistleblower website WikiLeaks. The footage was portrayed as classified, but the individual who leaked it, U.S. Army soldier Chelsea Manning, testified in 2013 that the video was not classified. The video, which WikiLeaks titled Collateral Murder, showed the crew firing on a group of men and killing several of them, then laughing at some of the casualties, all of whom were civilians, including two Reuters journalists. An anonymous U.S. military official confirmed the authenticity of the footage, which provoked global discussion on the legality and morality of the attacks.â€�

Their revenge is to try to disappear him into the darkest recesses of their prison system for the rest of his life to deter others from holding governments to account.

         It seems as if Assange is an enemy of the political class for spilling their secrets. I do not know how Assangeâ€™s eventual life behind bars fits in with the Umfuld narrative that Assange is a part of the establishment.
