     <h3 style="color:#000000;">
      Why are you selling cards? Why don't you cash out the cards yourselves?
     </h3>
     <p>
      We do it. Just not every single one, that would be definitely
 too risky. As said in the "About" tab, "giving the money away" is just
an protection for us by making sure the cards aren't cashing out only in
 single area by us. It makes it easier for us to cash them out safely.
We also can't really cash them all out, the amount of dirty money gone
from the ATMs would attract some unwanted attention that could lead to a
 serious investigation.

      Can I receive the dumps of the cards digitally?
     </h3>
     <p>
      Yes, that is possible. We will encrypt the email and send you the details of the card in there. That way you will save on shipping, yet will not receive the physical card. You will also receive the dumps much faster, in up to 2 hours after we confirm the payment, to be exact.

      How safe are those cards in reality?
     </h3>
     <p>
      VISA / Master Card / American Express Prepaid cards are absolutely zero-risk, yet you don't even need to hide your identity that much when using them. It's the best to remain as unsuspicious as it's possible when using them. It's impossible to track you down solely by your look, unless you are a celebrity or something.

    <div class="title">
     <h3 style="color:#000000;">

     </h3>
     <p>
      No. You do not necessarily have to order them straight to your door. It is up to you where you want the cards delivered. For example, you can have them shipped to a post office or courier service office.

      What is the expiration date of those cards?
     </h3>
     <p>
      VISA Prepaid cards should last 2-3 years. Cloned cards last a
 couple of years, we guarantee you won't run out of time to cash them
out. If the card gets blocked before you use it, we will send you a
replacement card free of charge.

    <div class="title">
     <h3 style="color:#000000;">
      Is it possible to refill the prepaid card?
     </h3>
     <p>
      Technically it would be possible, but we won't do it. No
recharges are available to make sure no suspicion arises and to leave
the least traces. It's really troubling to go trough all the
verification just to refill the card. There's a very low limit for the
recharges, so for both yours and ours safety it's better to get a new
card with no history of transactions. We don't want it to be blocked or
get any unwanted attention because of the high recharge amounts.
