        Are you new to the arena of the Dark Web and want to explore the
        <strong>
         Darknet
        </strong>
        ? Or are you someone who wants to know how to safely access the Dark Web? If the answer to this is yes, then you have landed in the right place without a doubt.
       </p>
       <p>
        This particular guide will suffice to have in-depth knowledge of the topics discussed here. Without strict privacy or any sort of rigid security, accessing the
        <strong>
         Dark Web Links
        </strong>
        can be hazardous.
       </p>
       <p class="has-text-align-justify">
        You should not access any of the Dark Web links exposed in the

       </p>
       <p>
        For your convenience, we are sharing a brief introduction of the Deep Web and the Dark Web.

       <p class="has-text-align-justify">
        Do you know that the content or the information you surf on the internet is just 4% of the total internet available? You might wonder what happens to the rest. Well, the remaining 96% of the internet is comprised of the Deep Web and the
        <strong>
         <a aria-label="Dark Web (opens in a new tab)" class="ek-link" data-mil="64" href="https://torhiddenlinks.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
          Dark Web
         </a>
        </strong>
        . You can consider the whole situation as the glacier in the ocean for instance. The part of the glacier that is visible can be compared to the surface web (the internet access made available to the common people that is 4%). The surface web comprises of several search engines like the Google, Bing etc. On the contrary, the remaining portion of the glacier that remains submerged in the ocean can be considered as the Deep Web and the Dark Web (composed of the remaining 96% of the total internet).
       </p>
       <p class="has-text-align-justify">
        Various academic information and other government resources are located in the Deep Web while all sorts of illegal activities like illegal porn, illegal funds transfer and related information along with the TOR encrypted sites as well as hacking information are confined in the Dark Web. That being said, this does not mean that the dark web and the deep web is completely illegal. There are various
        <strong>
         <a aria-label=".onion links (opens in a new tab)" class="ek-link" data-mil="64" href="https://torhiddenlinks.org/" rel="noreferrer">
          .onion links
         </a>
        </strong>
        on the Tor network that are completely legal such as radio website or chess playing website etc. Therefore, it can be concluded that the Deep Web and the Dark Web has the private access that a limited amount of people can access that too with rigid security measures. This is because getting your IP tracked or losing your identity are some of the common peril you invite if proper security is not maintained.

        There are certain pointers that you need to keep in mind before or while accessing the
        <strong>
         Dark Web Directories
        </strong>
        anytime. Below are the pointers or the Dos and Don’ts that you need to abide by in order to keep all the security risks at bay:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         You should not share your identity with anyone while surfing contents on the Dark Web. You must keep your original details private and not use them on the Dark Web.
        </li>
        <li>
         Before accessing the
         <strong>
          Dark Web Sites Links
         </strong>
         , you must unplug and close all the external applications or devices like the pen drives, hard disk drives etc.
        </li>
        <li>
         You should always block the webcam and the microphone before accessing the Dark Web. In case you want to stay double protected, you should mask the webcam using black tape.
        </li>
        <li>
         The most important thing that should be given priority is to buy a premium VPN (Virtual Private Network), install in your desktop and connect it to the TOR browser before you start off surfing. Here we are using the PureVPN because it provides 256 Bit encryption and completes IP address masking increasing your anonymity.
        </li>
        <li>
         You must use the TOR browser after disabling the Javascript.

       <p class="has-text-align-justify">
        Clearnet, also known as the surface web, is the accessible internet where the websites are crawled by the search engine bots and are indexed according to the categories of the websites. This part of the internet is what general people access via different regular browsers and search engines. It is just the opposite of the

        and the dark web. The clear web does not offer anonymity, neither does it have any anonymity tools. This means that browsing the clearnet is not anonymous. Most of the clearnet websites identify the users on a regular basis with the help of the IP addresses along with other data transmitted by the client.

        We have been talking about the VPN for a really long time and you might just want to know what VPN is. In this segment, you will know about the VPN.
       </p>
       <p class="has-text-align-justify">
        The Virtual Private Network, commonly known as VPN is a connection method that is meant to provide you with the maximum security from the loss of your identity or mask your IP address by making your connection private. One needs to have a strong VPN to:

        <li>
         Hide and change the IP Address

         Encrypt the data transfers
        </li>
        <li>
         Mask the user’s location
        </li>
        <li>
         Access all the blocked websites.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p class="has-text-align-justify">
        VPN is the top priority thing you must go for if you are about to access any information from the Deep Web or Dark Web. The Dark Web is a huge hub of all sorts of illegal activities and illegal information which are very risky to access without a premium VPN. A premium VPN will offer you a complete security package unlike the free or the limited ones. We recommend you to purchase the premium version of the
        <strong>
         PureVPN

        connection as you will be able to enjoy a bundle of features offered to provide maximum security.

       <ul>
        <li>
         You should never use your real name or pictures anywhere on the dark web.
        </li>
        <li>
         Make sure not to use an already used/previously used email id and password. Instead, you must register yourself with an encrypted email service provider and use aliases that cannot be tracked.

        <li>
         In order to make any purchases on the dark web, make sure to do it with an anonymous Bitcoin wallet.

        <li>
         Never install any browser plugins as they might use techniques to reveal your real location.

Hot wallets are those that need an active internet connection for it to perform while on the contrary, the cold wallets are offline wallets like pen drives, hard drives or physical paper etc. There are various ways to buy Bitcoin, for example cryptocurrency exchanges, physically by meeting someone who would transact digitally, PayPal, Bitcoin ATMs and more.

        As already mentioned, the dark web is a hub for illegal activities. Some of the prominent crimes happen here. This is the reason why the FBi and other law enforcement bodies monitor the darknet posing as regular individuals. The new users might not know this and they might get preyed on by the agents. You have to be extremely sound while surfing the dark web or having a conversation. It is recommended that you must not go with the flow and spit out your personal details or histories.

        Drug dealing is one of the most renowned illegal activities on the dark web. Despite the huge number of shutdowns and seizures, various vendor shops and dark web markets continue to exist and operate largely on the darknet. Vendors from all across the world sell different kinds of drugs to people located far and near. So, what actually getting into a case involving drugs means? Well, it means that you might get caught by the FBI or other law enforcement authorities if you make any opsec mistake or that you visit the dark web without any proper precaution.

       <p class="has-text-align-justify">
        Also, it needs to be mentioned that people who regularly visit the dark web or have been doing so for a good old time, have a less tendency to attract the attention of the law enforcement agencies. This is because they are aware of what to do, how to do, where to start from and who to deal with. That being said, there are people, who despite these awareness gets caught. So, literally dark web and anonymity could not guarantee that you would be safe completely. It is just taking some measures to delay the wrong incidences and survive for a greater period.

        There are a good number of methods that keep the web pages away from being indexed by the conventional search engines. Here is the categorized reference:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         <strong>
          Web Archives:
         </strong>
         Various web archival services such as the Wayback machine promote users to keep track of the achieved versions of the web pages across different periods. This includes websites that are now inaccessible and remain unindexed by the search giants like Google and Bing.
         <strong>
         </strong>
        </li>
        <li>
         <strong>
          Unlinked Content:
         </strong>
         The web pages that are not linked to other pages may prevent crawling as the Web Crawling programs could not access their content. This content is termed as pages without backlinks or inlinks. Another fact is that the search engines do not always identify all the backlinks searched from the web pages.
        </li>
        <li>
         <strong>
          Software:
         </strong>
         Specific content is kept hidden from the usual Internet intentionally, and they are accessible only via the special software like I2P, Tor or other darknet softwares. For instance, Tor permits the users to access websites utilizing the .onion server address completely anonymously, masking their IP address.
        </li>
        <li>
         <strong>
          Scripted Content:
         </strong>
         These are pages that are solely accessible via the links produced by JavaScript and the content downloaded dynamically from the web servers using Ajax and Flash solutions.
        </li>
        <li>
         <strong>
          Private Web:
         </strong>
         These are sites that require registration and login. They are mainly password-protected resources.

        <li>
         <strong>
          Text / Non-HTML Content:
         </strong>
         These are textual content that remains encoded in the multimedia such as image or video files or specific file formats and are not handled by the search engines.
        </li>
        <li>
         <strong>
          Content With Limited Access:
         </strong>
         Various websites limit access to some of their pages intentionally in a technical way such as using the no-store directive that prohibits the search engines from browsing them and making cached copies or using CAPTCHAs or Robots Exclusion Standard.
        </li>
        <li>
         <strong>
          Dynamic Content:
         </strong>
         Some dynamic pages are returned in response against a submitted query or are accessed only via a form, primarily if the open-domain input elements have been used. These kinds of the field are difficult to navigate without the knowledge of the domain.

          The question clearly reflects the misconception of the dark web where most people tend to rely solely on the idea that all the websites listed on the onion directories are illegal. Yes, it is true that the dark web is a haven for illegal activities such as trade of drugs, weapons, ammunition and other ruthless services like hitman-for-hire. But, this does not mean that the dark web is purely illegal. There are a lot of websites on the darknet that are pretty important and whose sole reason for being there is security and anonymity such as the secure email services, news portals, online libraries and related. You just need to apply your common sense before randomly hitting on a dark net site to easily stay away from any legal trouble.

          The only browser you must place your trust on to visit the various dark web sites is the Tor browser as it already possesses some built in security and as well as privacy features. Most importantly, the Tor browser offers encryption at each and every node from which your traffic passes – calculated to be at least three. Also, moving your traffic via different servers provides you with a high degree of privacy.

          The fact is finding the dark web sites or the deep web websites is a little tricky as the dark web is not that easy to navigate unlike the clearnet or surface web. This is owing to the irrelevant and complex looking dark web links on the onion directory. Luckily, a couple of index websites are available on the dark web that lists out a couple of websites or the dark web links and categorizes them. Hidden Wiki and Daniel are some to mention.
