      What are stolen Cards?
     </h1>
     <p>
      When we talk about stolen cards, we do NOT mean physically stolen cards. We speak of stolen data. There
                are different ways of getting such data.
     </p>
     <h3>
      Skimming
     </h3>
     <p>
      Skimming is when a small electronic device is used to copy and store credit card information. Skimmed
                information can be used to produce a counterfeit card — for instance, it may be loaded onto a prepaid
                card.
     </p>
     <p>
      Skimming happens a few different ways. It could occur when the credit card is removed from the owners
                possession, like at restaurants when the card is hand over to pay the check. It may also happen via a
                skimmer attached to a third-party card reader, like those on pumps at the gas station or on ATMs.
     </p>
     <h3>
      Phishing
     </h3>
     <p>
      Phishing is a scam to get personal information — like Social Security numbers, account numbers or card
                numbers — from consumers. It can occur via email, phone, text or snail mail.
     </p>
     <p>
      Phishers gain the victims trust by using familiar logos and company names to represent themselves, or
                scaring the victim into believing that their personal information is already compromised, and that you
                need to provide information immediately for damage control.
     </p>
     <h3>
      Spyware
     </h3>
     <p>
      Spyware is software designed to collect information without the victim’s knowledge or consent. It can
                collect personal data like credit card and banking information, as well as user logins from the
                computers it’s installed on.
     </p>
     <h1>
      Here’s how using our Service is on a
      <u>
       complete other Level
      </u>
      and how it will help you avoid costly
                mistakes and shortcut your way to starting a successful money making machine...
     </h1>
     <p>
      We DON’T make use of any of those techniques mentioned before. WE ARE INSIDERS. Now you can think what
                you want, but we are making profit of our situation. We are a small Team with Administrators,
                Technicians, Developer and Engineers acting within a huge international company with access to dozens of
                clients databases. THESE DATABASES CONTAIN MILLIONS OF USER PAYMENT DATA.
     </p>
     <p>
      So we don’t need to collect them first or buy them in bulk from other marketplaces. We are taking them
                from the source in a nearly unlimited amount.

      Too good to be true?
     </h1>
     <p>
      We can fully understand your skepticism, but give us the chance to explain ourselves.
     </p>
     <h2>
      Why don’t you use the cards by your own?
     </h2>
     <p>
      That might be the first question which comes to mind. We have access to an unlimited amount of payment
                data. The dumbest thing we could do is using these accounts by ourselves. We are a group of five
                individuals. Making 10k/month for everyone would mean cashing out 50k per month.
     </p>
     <p>
      IF we would cash out 50k/month on a regular basis, then there is a high activity in a tiny area. This
                will lead to an investigation and later compromise our identity. We are bind to the location where we
                are living and working. Yes, you read it right, we are still employed. The main goal is accumulating as
                much Bitcoin as possible for the next years and leaving the company we are still working for WHILE
                staying anonym and safe. We are just some regular nerds.
     </p>
     <h2>
      Why are you selling so low?
     </h2>
     <p>
      Honesty the data is worthless for us. Like explained we can’t use them. Only the demand gives it its
                value. And the Darknet is the perfect place to sell it.
     </p>
     <p>
      The best way to reach our goal is to make as many people satisfied as possible. We have almost no effort
                running this business. The process on the website is automated and the daily shipments are handled by a
                deck company. Additionally we are an organized team. Email communication get handled in our daily
                business. Our database get updated on a regular basis and the prepared cards are safely stored.

         We never resell any cards or information, you will be the only buyer

         As soon as your order contains
         <strong>

         we need a real shipping
                        address. There is absoulutely no risk of using your private address, because our post looks like
                        a regular credit card mailing.
        </p>
        <p>
         Some of our buyers told us they rent an AirBnB to receive Darknet packages. Nevertheless please
                        never tell us in which way you are related to your shipping information.
        </p>
        <p>
         Additionally we recommend everyone to use safe Email Services like secmail.pro, protonmail.com
                        or ctemplar.com. Services like Gmail, Hotmail or Yahoo are not safe.

         First of all, our System encrypts every information you put in a

         You can buy as much as you are feeling good with. We recommend buying

                    amount you need also to live in a big city with +3 million people.

        <p>
         There several reasons to that decision.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Our security
         </strong>
         <br/>
         With all those placed got shut down and up again, we can't be
                        sure who ist running the servers. Obviously ther is no further explanation need to this point.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          The process
         </strong>
         <br/>
         If we would run this business on a marketplace - which we
                        considered - than there where a lot more administartive work to do. We cpouldn't automate this
                        business like we did. I hope you get the point.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          The buying experience
         </strong>
         <br/>
         Also we wanted to accelerate the buying process. We
                        are not interested to run this business for the rest of our lives. As long as we feel save in
                        our position, we will sell those information. Designing a own buying process will satisfy our
                        clients and hopefully lead to more sells.
