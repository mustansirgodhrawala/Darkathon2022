            We do it. Just not every single one, that would be definitely too risky. As said in the "About" tab, "giving the money away" is just an protection for us by making sure the cards aren't cashing out only in single area by us. It makes it easier for us to cash them out safely. We also can't really cash them all out, the amount of dirty money gone from the ATMs would attract some unwanted attention that could lead to a serious investigation.

            Technically it would be possible, but we won't do it. No recharges are available to make sure no suspicion arises and to leave the least traces. It's really troubling to go trough all the verification just to refill the card. There's a very low limit for the recharges, so for both yours and ours safety it's better to get a new card with no history of transactions. We don't want it to be blocked or get any unwanted attention because of the high recharge amounts.

          Q: Hello... I came across your webpage and I have some questions regarding the cards:
                                Are these cards prepaid cards or cloned cards? (It really doesn't matter I just need a lot of money ASAP)
                                If I order 20 or 30 is there a risk for being caught?
                                Do you deliver to Guatemala?
                                Which courrier do you use?
                                What would be the total cost of the card (with shipping) to Guatemala?
                                If I order a card, what name will be in the card? My name? Any name I want? A random name?
                                Will the card permit me to take out money from an ATM?
                                Sorry for asking so many questions, I am just nervous and want to be 100% sure.
                                If everything works out with the first cart I will order in a week or so, I will order 10 or 20.... that's why I ask.
         </p>
         <p>
          R: Prepaid cards work anywhere in the world. Random name on the card. Delivery popular courier services. The limit for withdrawal at ATMs $ 1500 per day. Regular delivery 3-5 days. Payment on the website or a direct Deposit to the purse BTK. After payment, send the transaction number and shipping address. When buying 20-30 cards 25% discount. When you withdraw cash from ATMs and online purchases there is no risk!
