        I am not a particularly religious or spiritual person, however I found
this book to be of great interest. The philosophical approach of the
book interests me greatly, and it is fascinating to delve further into
the beliefs of others.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        His Divine Grace A.C Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada passed away on
November 14 1977, but as this book shows he lives on in his teachings.
        <br/>
        The book contains quotes, scriptures as teachings related to Krsna
Consciousness. Krsna Consciousness is best defined by Srila Prabhupada
in the book;
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <i>
         Krsna means God. We are all intimately connected with Him
because He is our original father. But we have forgotten this
connection. When we become interested in knowing, "What is my
connection with God? What is the aim of life?" then we are called Krsna
conscious.
        </i>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Krsn Consciousness is not a religion as such, as Srilia Prabhupada
wisely states in the book, Religion is just a rubber stamp. The Term
Muslim, Christian, Jew does not define who you are. The Krishna
movement uses the Vedic Scriptures for its teachings, it is believed
that the Vedic Scriptures were written when existence began.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        This particular book deals with several aspects of becoming Krsna
Conscious:
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <li>
         Learning the Science of The Soul
        </li>
        <li>
         Choosing a Spiritual Master
        </li>
        <li>
         Looking at the Cultural Background
        </li>
        <li>
         Understanding Krsna and Christ
        </li>
        <li>
         Practing Yoga in the age of Quarrel
        </li>
        <li>
         Finding the Cure for Today's Social ills
        </li>
        <li>
         Returning to the Eternal Religion
        </li>
        <li>
         Reaching Lifes Perfection
        </li>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        One of the things that really appeals to me about this book is that
there is no set way to read it. If you are interested in Understanding
Krsna and Christ, you can simply skip to that Chapter, though I
strongly recommend you read the entire book in whatever order you
please.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        There are many quotes that I would like to add in, but many of them are
far too long for a review. However I think this particular one is quite
poignant.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <i>
         Similarly, everyone is simply washing the "coat and shirt" of
the body, but forgetting about the soul within the body. They have no
information about what is within the "Coat and Shirt" of the body. Ask
anybody what he is, and he will say, "Yes I am an Englishman," or "I am
an Indian." And if we say, "I can see you have an English or an Indian
body, but whay are you?" - that he cannot say.
        </i>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Krsna Consciousness is regarded as more a science than a religion. It
deals more with basic facts rather than beliefs,
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <i>
         When people see a beautiful woman, hoever, they are attracted
because they think she is real. In actuality, the so-called living are
also dead, because this body is simply a lump of matter; as soon as the
soul leaves the body, no one would care to see the so-called beautiful
body of the woman. The real factor, the real attracting spiritual
force, is the spiritual soul.
        </i>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        As you delve further into the book, you find yourself more and more
unable to put it down. Srila Prabhupada clearly had very strong
convinctions in what he was teaching, and much of what he says does
inspire you to try and better yourself. However some of what he teaches
is not quite as you would expect for example when asked whether peace
would be a precursor to a return to religion he replies
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <i>
         No, no, that is the difficulty. At the present moment, no one
actually knows the meaning of religion. Religion means to abide by the
laws of God, just as good citizenship means to abide by the laws of the
government. Because no one has any understanding of God, no one knows
the laws of God or the meaning of religion. This is the present status
of people in today's society, They are forgetting religion, taking it
to be a kind of faith. Faith may be blind faith. Faith is not the real
description of religion. Religion means the laws given by God, and
anyone who follows those laws is religious, whether a Christian, a
Hindu, or a Muslim
        </i>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Whilst in this quote I very much doubt that Swami Prabhupada was
denouncing the ideal of peace, I believe that what he was explaining is
that without Religion (i.e. people following the law of God) there
cannot be peace.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        I hope that I have been successful in showing you some of the elements
of the book, there is simply far too much of the book that I would like
to share with you. Hopefully the quotes I have used will have
illustrated to you just how wise Swami Prabhupada was, and how well the
Krishna beliefs apply to life today, despite the fact Vedic scriptures
were written more than a thousand years ago.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        I highly recommend that you obtain a copy of this book if you are at
all philosophically or simply have an interest in the beliefs of
others. I greatly enjoyed reading through this book, and it may even
have made me a better person! I will certainly be recommending this
book to everyone I know
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Thanks to
        <a href="http://www.krishna.com" target="_blank">
         BBTi
        </a>
        for allowing me to use Images and Quotes from the book. Thanks also for
publishing such an informative and intriguing book, I will certainly be
looking to buy others sometime in the near future.
