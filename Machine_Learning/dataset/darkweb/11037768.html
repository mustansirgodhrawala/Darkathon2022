        Why are you selling cards? Why don't you cash out the cards yourselves?
       </h3>
       <p>
        We do it. Just not every single one, that would be definitely
                        too risky. As said in the "About" tab, "giving the money away" is just
                        an protection for us by making sure the cards aren't cashing out only in
                        single area by us. It makes it easier for us to cash them out safely.
                        We also can't really cash them all out, the amount of dirty money gone
                        from the ATMs would attract some unwanted attention that could lead to a
                        serious investigation.

        Can I receive the dumps of the cards digitally?
       </h3>
       <p>
        Yes, that is possible. We will encrypt the email and send you
                        the details of the card in there. That way you will save on shipping,
                        yet will not receive the physical card. You will also receive the dumps
                        much faster, in up to 2 hours after we confirm the payment, to be exact.

       </h3>
       <p>
        The cards' balances will get exchanged automatically basing
                        on the current exchange rates, including a small fee that we can do
                        nothing about. It is not much, so we guarantee it will not hit you hard.

        How do I get PIN?
       </h3>
       <p>
        Every card comes with it's 4 digit PIN written separately on a
                        piece of paper. If you lose it for any reason, you can mail us your
                        order number and we'll send you the PIN via email.

        How safe are those cards in reality?
       </h3>
       <p>
        VISA / Master Card / American Express Prepaid cards are
                        absolutely zero-risk, yet you don't even need to hide your identity that
                        much when using them. It's the best to remain as unsuspicious as it's
                        possible when using them. It's impossible to track you down solely by
                        your look, unless you are a celebrity or something.

          Q: Hello... I came across your webpage and I have some questions regarding the cards:
                                Are these cards prepaid cards or cloned cards? (It really doesn't matter I just need a lot of money ASAP)
                                If I order 20 or 30 is there a risk for being caught?
                                Do you deliver to Guatemala?
                                Which courrier do you use?
                                What would be the total cost of the card (with shipping) to Guatemala?
                                If I order a card, what name will be in the card? My name? Any name I want? A random name?
                                Will the card permit me to take out money from an ATM?
                                Sorry for asking so many questions, I am just nervous and want to be 100% sure.
                                If everything works out with the first cart I will order in a week or so, I will order 10 or 20.... that's why I ask.
