     <h4>
      What are those BTC Wallets ?
     </h4>
     <p class="text_column">
      "BTC Wallets" is the new service from LordPay , It's a simple process you will buy the desired wallet from us we will send you a wallet.dat file witht the password(if needed) you will import it into some wallet software that supports .dat files and valla . You have access to the funds and you must spend them as soon as possible. Why don't we cash them out ourself ? good question , Because It's not safe for us to have this much money come into our accounts suddenly and we must deal with all kinds of government agencies. And we do not want that.
