       FAQ
      </h1>
      <p>
       We always get a lot of questions. Mostly the same so before contacting us, check your question here:
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Why do you sell them?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Good question. We need to sell accounts because we (and you) can’t cash out an infinite amount of accounts. We advise clients to cash out not more then 5/6 accounts per month since there is one thing you don’t want and that is raising suspicion.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        How do I cashout?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       First off all, cashing out is always at your own risk and we will only help you with it. After your purchase we will send you a small PDF with extra cashing out instructions together with your login credentials.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, there are multiple ways to cash out all depending on where you want to cash out and based on your computer knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
       On this page we will only discuss the most secure and safe way; buying bitcoins with your bought account. Other ways to cash out can be buying giftcards with it or go shopping at some safe shops.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Buying Bitcoins with your bought account?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       This can be done at multiple places like Virwox for example. For other vendors who accept PayPal to buy bitcoins please check Howtobuybitcoins.info. Once you have the bitcoins it’s easy to launder them and to cash them out to your own account or to buy something at Silk Road for example…
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Can I cash the account out from every country?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Good question again. If you buy an account from inside europe and you are inside europe yourself or when you’re in the US and you want to cash out an american account this should be no problem and you should have the money within a few hours. If you want to cash out from Uganda or another god forgotten please ask us for a SOCKS5 proxy in your additional note field when you’re ordering.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        How fast will the account be send?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       At daytime (in Europe) we can respond within 2/3 hours and verify the payment. In weekends and at night this might be 6 hours max. After 10 hours without reply please mail us again and ask if we’re still alive!
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        When will some new accounts arrive?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       That depends. As a group of hackers we don’t have a solid flow of accounts. It can takes weeks before new accounts arrive sometimes but normally we add 10/20 new accounts every 3/4 days.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        How do I pay?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       The only method to pay us are Bitcoins (so no Western Union, PayPal, and so on…). Bitcoins are the internet currency and are easy, cheap and fast to exchange. Its also the most safe method to do business with us since safety is our top priority. If you want more info about buying bitcoins in your country/area please check Howtobuybitcoins.info.
